5bb6969b9d37800b64317ffe,2018-10-04 22:39:23+00:00,,,5,Carl from the escalations team had a lovely manner and was very helpful. Keep priding yourself on high standards of service Carl!! And thanks for sorting the replacement out of my faulty phone.
5bb60cd49d37800734d8ad92,2018-10-04 12:51:32+00:00,,,4,Has been so straightforward since we switched from O2. Only issue was not being able to use data on recent holiday to Spain. Not much they could do now we're home but I think if I'd contacted them while away they could have solved the prob.
5bb2f4508c83fd0b58de76a2,2018-10-02 04:30:08+00:00,,,1,"I made a very bad decision to sign a 12 month  contract with TESCO MOBILE at £7.50 per month in June 2018. It promised 500 mins 5000 texts and I forget how many Gigabytes of data. (exact GB's not important in this review). Great I thought. However in month two of the contract I noticed the amount of my bill was not £7.50, but £8,25, 75p more than expected. I gave TESCO a call and asked why my bill was not £7.50 as expected, but £8.25. They told me it was because some of my texts (3 to be precise)  exceeded 160 characters and therefore had been converted from a standard FREE TEXT into MMS messages by TESCO and each MMS message they charged an extra 25p for. Outrageous I thought. I remember speedreading the contract and accompanying Terms and Conditions (T and Cs) and had not spotted anywhere where it was stated that any text exceeding 160 characters would be charged at 25p a text, or rather 25p for the MMS message that the ""FREE"" text had been changed to by TESCO MOBILE. I asked them to tell me exactly where in the contract I had signed it mentioned anything at all about TEXTS of any description being converted into MMS messages at 25p a go. They told me it was there in plain view in the contract. I sent the actual contract to my solicitor friend who went through it with a fine toothed comb and a word processor to search for any mention of extra charges , or a full list of which specific texts were converted into MMS by TESCO and charged 25p extra each time. I pointed out unless the bill payer/phone user is made aware of which texts are converted into extra charged MMS messages from FREE TEXTS,  the user can have no foreknowledge of  what some might call a RIPOFF, and will inevitably fall into the pit of extra charges as we are completely blind and unaware of how we might avoid any of these extra charges. I rang back and told TESCO MOBILE there was no mention of any of these extra charges in the contract at all. They then changed their tune and told me the warnings about these extra charges were actually not in the contract, but in the attached T and Cs. So we repeated the same test in this block of text, attached below the signed contract. Likewise here there is no mention of any extra charges, free texts being converted into MMS message, which are charged extra at 25p a message, or any list of exactly why a so called expected FREE text is deemed not to be free by TESCO, and so is charged at 25p a go.  So for the second time we informed TESCO what they had told us was not true, and if they did not agree would they simply identify the page and paragraph(s) in which these extra charges were laid out in plain sight for all to see, as TESCO had always maintained.So this time they now changed the story again, and it gets better! We were now told The relevant text was actually not in the contract I had signed or it's accompanying T and Cs section at all. No they said it was actually in the T and C's on the TESCO website. I pointed out that a website is able to be changed by TESCO at any time it suited them, so unless I was given a copy of that page I could never be sure TESCO had not changed the details of the contract at some point in the future. Indeed in NORMAL business circles a signed contract is usually in one stapled or tied up block of pages, which cannot easily be amended. Each person on both sides of the contract get a copy, and signs it, safe in the knowledge neither side can add or subtract anything from the contract at all, and in the contract all and every extra charge should be mentioned if TESCO wish to rely on it to justify additional charges.  This provides security for both sides involved. For TESCO to refer to some changeable text on a website I was never shown at all before signing the contract I thought was the COMPLETE and FULL  contract, seems to me what some might call cheating or keeping the customer in complete darkness.Anyway just to make sure TESCO had finally , at the third attempt identified where this vital information re the structure of the extra charges and the list of all messages which would be charged extra for, we once again checked the TESCO WEBSITE T and Cs to verify this was where the UP FRONT, OUT IN THE OPEN warnings about extra charges, TESCO claimed to be, actually were. However once again when we used a word processor to search for any mention of extra charges, FREE TEXTS being converted into extra charged MMS texts at 25p each   etc. once again we discovered there was no mention  of any of these things even in the TESCO website's T and Cs. WE challenged TESCO to identify exactly which page, and paragraph was supposed to contain this vital information, and once again for the 4th time TESCO  changed its story.  They now said, the actual warnings were  not in the contract I signed, nor the attached and signed T and Cs. Also they were not in the TESCO website's  T and Cs, but they were as I had always asserted buried in some obscure place, hidden from the customer so we would have no idea about any of these extra charges at all, and so would unwittingly inevitably end up incurring extra charges, and profits for TESCO, at the expense of the blind uninformed customer.This turned out to be true as the actual warnings that texts of more than 160 characters would be converted to MMS messages, at 25p a time  were buried in a help section on the TESCO website, which was neither mentioned or referred to anywhere at all in the entire contract, so one would never know it was even important to know about Here were hidden the words mentioning every text containing more than 160 characters would be charged extra for, as an MMS message, and every subsequent 160 characters would be charged as an extra text, no mention at all that each extra 160 characters in a text would be charged as an extra text, at 25 pence each extra 160 characters at all. So a text with 161 characters costs 25 pence extra, 321 characters cost 50p and each additional 160 characters would be costing an extra  25p each time. I believe this is a form of deception in my opinion. When I asked for a full and exhaustive list of all types of texts which would be charged extra for by  TESCO even now they still refused to provide me with a full and proper list. I was told only that each additional 160 characters would be charged as an extra text, which might easily be construed as being one of the 5000 free ones? No, they are all charged at 25 each, but that figure is never specifically mentioned at all.  I was emailed some further types of texts which would be converted into MMS texts, and these are regardless of the number of characters. It is just the type of character which triggers the extra cost. For example, by merely using some simple characters like () brackets, that would be enough for the text to be converted into a MMS at 25p a go as in their opinion those brackets could be used as part of an emoticon, which might look like  a face or something similar. I was told also in an email (but you wont find it anywhere in the contract, or any T and Cs, or on the website)  that there are other similar kinds of characters which have the same effect of triggering them being charged as an extra text, but  they would or could not tell me the full list of all the characters which would trigger the extra 25p charge. I found out from a friend that TESCO also charge 25p extra for a text which contains a phone number, as TESCO call that a calling card. No mention of this either, on the website, in the contract or either of the T and Cs.. So I challenged TESCO to come clean and admit this was not god business practice, and was keeping customers in the dark as to how they might become knowledgeable of how to prevent falling into the extra charges trap if we were not aware of the potential risks of using any particular character or other which might trigger the 25p extra charge.  TESCO refused to accept they were doing anything illegal, misleading or wrong. I disagree. All over the TESCO stores and website, claims of 5000 FREE TEXTS A MONTH scream at potential customers, but on none of those flyers , posters etc, does it warn of any of the 5000 ""FREE"" TEXTS  being charged at the rate of 25p a text, (or rather once converted by TESCO into an MMS message!) When I challenged this underhanded  and to me not completely truthful advertising and asked the Advertising Standards Authority if it was legal or not they told me Tesco can get away with not mentioning any of these extra charges anywhere in any part of their flyers or posters in the Tesco phone shops or on their website, as the ASA only has jurisdiction over PAID FOR advertising, not TESCO's own flyers and posters. How wonderful I thought! Apparently TESCO dont pay for millions of flyers and posters which appear to me to be designed very specifically to mislead people and generate extra income for TESCO at the uninformed customer's expense. I told TESCO I am a disabled,  pensioner and suffer from many medical and mental health issues, and felt any text which did not form a part of the contract, should not be relied upon by TESCO as justification for what I feel is actually stealing from people, they told me it was all totally legal. I challenge that notion, and if by virtue of TESCO's massive financial clout they are allowed to do this, someone should put a stop to it right away. I told TESCO I believe what they have been doing might have potentially made them millions of pounds in extra charges and they should refund that money they had taken from unsuspecting customers back to those customers immediately they would not accept that at all. I further told them I believed if by some clever methodology TESCO had managed to find  a technically legal way to continue, in my opinion  to rip off unsuspecting customers,  that was immoral, unethical, and stank to high heaven. TESCO did not seem to care. My advice is don't trust TESCO MOBILE at all.   Shop elsewhere is my advice."

5babaecd8c83fd06e0c4c81e,2018-09-26 16:07:41+00:00,,,4,"As. PAYG Tesco sim customer I have always enjoyed good service but trying to swap my sim has proved problematic. Having bought a new  Lumia I needed a nano sim.  The Tesco phone shop provided me with a new sim with instructions how to transfer my existing sim over. It was easy to execute and all went well except the fact that my new phone tells me it’s number is that of the replacement sim and not my original number.p although the phone sends from my original number and receives calls to my original number.Tesco tell me to live with the issue but, and blame this on my OCD, but I would like things to be right. The issue must be something to do with the sim transfer, maybe the original number is embedded in the sim but whatever the reason it needs fixing Tesco. Oh, and before you tell me that I put the new sim in my phone before the transfer happened, no I didn’t. I waited over 24 hours before inserting it."

Such a simple request., They are going to send it to the wrong address after being told 7 times to send it to a different address. They ruined my dads 60th birthday surprise and trying now to get my neighbour to intercept it. I was told to phone DPD to change it. they told me to phone Tesco. Escalated and still couldnt help me. offered to provide ID and proof of purchase. Still couldnt help.Thanks for ruining everythingUnfortunately, i am locked into a contract but convinced my gf to leave tesco.Sorted Issue out"
5ba8c8948c83fd06e0c3cbad,2018-09-24 11:20:52+00:00,,,1,"For 8 years this company has been paid by me every month with never a payment late.  I go on holiday and tell them beforehand that my final payment of £12.50 will be a little late as I will be out of the country but I will pay as soon as I return, I'm told that's fine, I've never missed a payment for 8 years after all.  I follow up this conversation with an Email to confirm the arrangements, just to be on the safe side.  I pay the £12.50 on my return to the UK only to receive a week later a letter from a debt collection agency demanding payment.  I ring them up to be told that the £12.50 payment is still outstanding and hasn't been paid at all, but ""they would investigate"".  Never again Tesco mobile, you or your debt collection agency contact me one more time and you'll be speaking not with me but with my solicitor.  It's only £12.50 but by God you've really annoyed me.  This could potentially affect my credit rating."

5ba264838c83fd0b58d9d55b,2018-09-19 15:00:19+00:00,,,1,Awful customer care. i pay close to £10 a month in insurance to cover phone damages etc. my phone suffered water damage yesterday and i've been on the phone all morning after being told that the model of iphone i own is out of stock and i will just have to wait until it becomes available again to get a replacement. I pay the insurance to get the next day replacement service. Have been told they can't do anything despite the model being in stock on the website. Don't bother with the insurance it's a waste of time and had i known i would have to wait that long for the replacement i wouldn't have bothered with it in the first place.
5b9fa8fb8c83fd0b58d8e3f4,2018-09-17 13:15:39+00:00,,,1,"After 13 years of being with Tesco Mobile. I'm absolutely disgusted , the experience I've just gone through has made my mental health deteriorate, I feel sick and the whole experience has made me very emotionally unstable ! I've been lied too called my friend by a adviser !!! I was told I would receive a phone call from the escalations team on Wednesday 12th which didn't happen! I had to ring them back myself that evening only to be told they would ring me back by 7 pm this did  not happen ! I explained about 5 times I was going into hospital for a operation on Thursday 13th and I wouldn't be available but the escalation team still rang me and left an answer phone message on the day of the operation was incompetent on there part ! So this morning I rang them back and was told he was dealing with another compliant and was told he would ring me back in 20 -30 minutes,again this didn't happen so I've just had to ring customer care and explain myself again. I have just cancelled my contract,so thanks Tesco for taking my money and not even trying to keep me as a valued customer ?"

5b9e1ab08c83fd0b58d87fd1,2018-09-16 08:56:16+00:00,,,1,"Complete rip off!I have had two contracts with tesco mobile or over two years and not many problems until recently. I took out tesco mobile protect to insure one of my devices which got broken so made a claim. They send the new phone the next day and request you to return the broken device using the envelope they send. They did not send me an envelope, I called tesco mobile to request one and sent it off with recorded delivery. I received two emails from Tesco to say they had received my old device - 4 months later they have charged me £75 for not returning the device. Every time i called I was told new information that contradicted the last. My device was sent to tesco mobile warehouse not tesco mobile protect warehouse so that I why I was charged. I am as of yet to get this money back as this can take upto 8 weeks!! Not happy at all!! In all I was paying £6 a month for insurance, £40 excess fee for new device then £75 for non return of old device (which I did return and have proof of this) all on top of my usual £30 a month contract."
5b9d04408c83fd0b58d84ef0,2018-09-15 13:08:16+00:00,,,1,"To be honest, I don’t think I have ever had such a painful, stressful and frustrating experience, with any company.  I have been a Tesco mobile customer sine 2014, but decided recently to move providers as I could access a better deal.  Every time you call Tesco’s, you can at least be held on the phone for at least a period of 30 minutes plus.  I purchased my phone originally so I was not locked to a network.  I started out with Tesco and unbeknown to me they locked m6 phone to their network without informing me, when I asked where it said they would do this, in the small print, they could not respond.  I called and asked for a pac code, to transfer to my new provider, the advisor did not advise me that my phone was locked to Tesco’s, or when the pac code would become live, only that I had 30 days to use it.  Tesco’s cut my phone off les than 48 hours later.  I tried to use my new SIM card only to find out the phone was locked to Tesco’s.  I spent a further 40 minutes talking to their customer care team, who said they would get the phone unlocked, and this might take up to 7 days, I explaned that this left me with no phone for 7 days, but they took no responsibility despite the fact they originally locked the phone without informing me.  They said I would receive a code from apple to unlock it.  I have now waited for 5 days, still no code, so I went to the apple shop to ask if they could assist in what might be the hold up.  Apple devised me that they do not get involved with providing codes for unlocking and that Tesco’s would be informing me of the code, and it is the said company that provide the code to me.  Having then spent a further hour on the phone to Tesco’s speaking with at least 6 different people, I find myself no further forward than I was at the start of the week.  Tesco’s have been shocking and how they can call their team customer care, I do not undertstand.  I have never been so frustrated in dealing with a company where I was passed around with no resolution.  I will never buy another mobile phone, or SIM card via Tesco’s again, customer service was shocking.  Not at any point was I even offered any compensation for the amount of calls I had made, any stress that was caused, being misinformed, or even locking my phone ."
5b9cf69c8c83fd0b58d84b5c,2018-09-15 12:10:04+00:00,,,5,"We spoke to Katherine today regarding my Husbands pay as you go SIM she was very helpful, polite and couldn't have been more caring if she tried, the lady who sold the package to my husband didn't explain how the data worked to him, so unknowingly he used up all of his £10 without making hardly any calls, he did tell her all he wanted from the a phone was the ability to make calls and send texts, she didn't explain that you could turn the mobile data off!! Anyway as I said we spoke to Katherine, who took the trouble to explain all these things and returned the £10 to the phone, the mobile data is now turned OFF! Once again our very grateful thanks to Katherine for her kindness, patience and very helpful advice. you could certainly do with more Katherines on your team. Jenny and Julian Ollett"
5b9c0f188c83fd06e0c06090,2018-09-14 19:42:16+00:00,,,1,"Now a new customer service low from the company which brought you accounting fraud, mass data breaches and gender pay discrimination. I recently needed to replace a faulty handset for a new one with a different sim size. Tesco mobile took 4 days to transfer my existing Tesco mobile service to a new sim on their own network, leaving me tied to a handset which was freezing every couple of hours. No help from customer service who, despite admitting the cause was a known systems fault at the company, refused to help unless I destroyed my old sim which would have left me with no service whatsoever for 24 hours - or longer,depending on whether they could actually be bothered to transfer my service. Avoid."

5bcb98529d37800300d164c9,2018-10-20 21:04:18+00:00,,,1,I've been with Tesco Mobile since 27th May this year and thought I had got a good deal. How wrong was I wish I hadn't moved from 3 Mobile just because Tesco offered a cheaper deal. I can't get any signal indoors in any building no matter what town or city I am in. The answer from their customer service agent was to go and stand outside and make the call. As my parents live in Northern Ireland my phone calls are not 2 mins long but more like 30-60 mins long. Coming into the winter I shouldn't have to go and stand outside to make phone calls or send texts. I'm paying for a service and only receiving half a service. Wish I could go back in time so I didn't leave my old provider. Possibly going to have to buy a sim only from another provider just to be able to get coverage indoors and outdoors which is ridiculous. I will not be recommending Tesco Mobile to anybody and advising friends and family against them.
5bcb60019d37800300d156f9,2018-10-20 17:04:01+00:00,2018-10-20 17:05:14+00:00,,4,"Was with them for about 2 years, left last month as contract expired. The bad: I had a sim only deal before I bought a phone from them, so when I got the new tariff and phone I was told via the website that I'd be getting 2gb of data per month with the contract and the new tariff and phone would be 25£/month. I'm not sure what happened but I was kept on my old tariff but paying 25£/month. Spoke with 1 person and was then passed to someone else who confirmed I'd be getting 2gb of data with contract. Which didn't happen. As I didn't get use that much data back then it wasn't an issue until the last 6 months of the contract when I moved jobs and didn't get free WiFi at the new place so the last 6 months were painful. Also when I was leaving the company I had to speak with 5-6 people to get the special code that allows you to keep your number with new provider. Also you get poor value for money with their tariffs like £7.50 for 1gb data. The good: I got a 300£ Galaxy S6 back when S7 released plus ""200£"" wireless earphones. The phone was great, but the earphones take about 4hrs to charge, about twice the time the phone takes to charge and don't work with the Samsung app.. what a joke. I don't blame Tesco but what a rubbish I was gifted for ""200£"". Also their coverage is great and fast and back then prices were competitive."
5bcb13be9d37800b2443303c,2018-10-20 11:38:38+00:00,,,1,"If there was a 0 star rate I would use it. Tesco mobile is absolute rubbish, customer care is painful and negligent. especially on the chat, they ask you the same question over and over again and basically, nothing gets done. not sure where this is based but it certainly feels like talking to a wall.  An unauthorised payment was debited from my bank account and when I claimed this they said they couldnt find my details on their server and they couldnt help me, my bank couldnt refund because it was made via direct debit. not only they have STOLEN money from my account but they have also transfered bundles into standard rates which means instead of operating on a (for example) 5 GB bundle, they have charged standard rates and exhausted the credit in ONE DAY!. Claiming to have cancelled it without any explanation. obviously, they must be doing something right to be able to get away with this scam, so AVOID! at all cost. thet will misuse your card details, your top up credit and get away with is. Better not risk it, you won't win as they say ""you are not on our system, we can't help you""."

Rang through to be told retention team and Emily the agents attitude was horrendous and insulting. Asked to speak to her manager Tony but he was too busy watching his team to take calls. No interest in keeping customers and was sighed at and basically told I'm stupid. Will be taking my business elsewhere never experienced service so bad anywhere."

I have been in the USA for ten days and only able to send one text and make one phone call, the phone changes from Tesco to T mobile. On the recommendation of Tesco Northwich I purchased a Tesco international calling card and that does not work either. Have been into T mobile in Boston (Mas) they could not help. My phone is a Nokia C2. Not impressed with Tesco mobileHave spoken to Tesco customer services, the card I was sold in a Tesco branch in order to ring the UK from the USA is not for that purpose, it is for ringing abroad from the UK also my partner was told to download an app for the same reason. The staff in branch are clearly not trained in the products they sell and its not the staff's fault. It's Tesco's fault. They need to ensure that their staff are fully trained."

I rang them and they said a mass was under repair and if I want out of the area it would work. Well I went to a different city an hour away and it still wouldn't pick up. I rang them again and they said the same thing. I didn't believe them at this point so I factory reset my phone completely and it's working absolutely fine now. This worries me! Don't know if I'll be staying with Tesco mobile when my contract is up.

I obviously have no choice but to wait but I said I wanted to speak to customer service and was pointed downstairs to desk .The lady on desk did come straight to me as at this point I was in tears I am under so much stress with the whole transplant situation I think this just pushed me over . she took the phone and told me not to worry she would speak to phone manager who after 5 minuets appeared he came down wasn’t interested in helping   his answer was as before buy a basic phone then return it what has really upset me is his reply its only 20.00 and also his its policy which was said constantly he was very patronizing I tried to show proof of medical renal alart but he was not ––interested I left very upset I do understand you have policys but the phone is not fit for purpose and the fact that as a medical use phone you wouldn’t help one bit Also please don’t lie to customers I was told phone manager was out but when I went to customer service he suddenly appearedPlease don’t use phrase only 20 .00 its only 20 if you can afford it To be stood in customer service in tears and spoken to like that is disgusting   I am really distressed about the whole thing and came away still with phone that doesn’t work and having to wait now for return bag I hope no one who dealt with me goes through what I am going through but if they did they would understand why I am so upset and why being without phone is such a major issue"

They stole 320 euro from me, an insane amount and I'm calling it theft cause there's no way in hell they can justify the prices they charge.Also while paying the bill in payments they ignore me requests to pay it for days at a time and during that time periods they cut off my data and activate call barring so I can't call or text, and continue to ignore my constant requests into their help line on their Customer Service app.I'm completely disgusted with their horrific charges and especially their incredibly apathetic staff who don't care in the slightest about your situation. That is if you can actually get one of them on the phone or in the customer service chat, which they CHARGE you for in addition. Absolutely disgraceful in every possible sense."

My Samsung phone LCD have up the ghost just at the end of the contract, i went to the stores and they booked my phone in for repair knowing it had a small crack at the edge. i waited for five days to get the prepaid postage bag and sent it off to the repair team only to be emailed i voided the warranty. why did the store staff make me send it away and be without a phone for 7 days, if they were properly trained they should have known it voided warranty.this made me lose business for over a week as my work depends on my phone also. and the best training Steven and Nikki received from Tesco  was to ensure i paid the last balance of £43 before i could be eligible for an upgrade. after paying the same amount for 4 years consecutively, i should have realised tesco mobile was broke.What a way to retain customers after four years and Nikki the concerns manager told me over the phone not to bother with escalating the concern with the financial ombudsman as i wont get the outcome i was looking for. i have never been so shocked in my life.i regret being loyal to this company. don,t bother with them.p.s  I WAS ALSO PAYING EXTRA £2.50 BUFFER EVERY MONTH TO HAVE ENOUGH DATA.

I spoke to Apple who said it was a network issue. So after many calls to customer services and trying 2 new sims cards and every possible trouble shooting it still wouldn’t work. One thing I did notice is that every time I spoke to customer services and tried to access the internet it would not do it until I finished the call. I tried other SIM cards and there was no delay in iMessage or accessing the internet whilst on the phone.I then asked customer services how much it would it cost to exit the contract early and was told £54.99. They then told that if I sent in the phone to be checked and it was found to have nothing wrong with it I could leave without paying the fee. I then posted the posted the phone only to receive a phone call a few days later to ask for proof of purchase.I am  on a sim only deal as the phone was purchased from a third party and so I don’t have proof of purchase but I know the phone is no longer under warranty. I was then told they could not even look at the phone to tell me if it wasn’t faulty or even if it was faulty how much it was cost me to fix it without the proof of purchase. I cannot fault the customer service people I spoke to who tried to help troubleshoot the problem but I am very disappointed the repair team would not even consider looking at the phone and so I have no option but to pay the £54.99 and leave.I also sent two emails through the complaints link but after waiting a week for a reply I rang again only to be told the concerns department had no record of a complaint."

So receive a message yesterday advising my monthly payment is due for £12.50 on the 1st of December. I called Tesco mobile to find out what was going on and why the contract hadn’t been cancelled and was greeted with a lady called Alex who sounded like she was still hung over in bed! I explained the above but she simply tried to fob me off with the fact there was no record of a cancellation request made, explained about 5 times that their advisor did call to cancel in front of me in store, after going round in circles for 10 minutes she decided to speak to a manager only to come back and tell me that because I had used data a few days over the 19th she won’t be able to do anything and that I would have to make the second months payment for £12.50. I wasn’t 100% sure if I was told any remaining data could be used but asked her to ensure the contract is cancelled to which she replied yes it will cancel by the 16th of Jan!!I was horrified at this, it’s the 27th today I told her, I am calling to cancel an apparent 1 month rolling contract but actually it won’t cancel until the 16th of January, after questioning this Alex advised their billing cycle is on the 14th of every month so December bills have already been produced but she also told me the December billing cycle has been run as well due to Christmas and that the contract would end 16th Jan so I need to make December and Jan Payments! I couldn’t believe my ears, she again banged on about their billing cycle without even trying to understand the 1 month contract.  By this time I was at the end of my tether so she went back to her manager putting me on hold once again only to come and tell me she would give me 500 club card points but the contract will end 16th of Jan. I don’t want your club card points I want this contract which is now a nightmare to cancel! After being on the phone for over half an hour trying to cancel this contract I gave up trying to explain to her because I simply was not getting anywhere at all, I simply advised I would cancel the direct debit to which she threatened me with Debt collection. Well that was it I lost it, I quit explaining and told her how their so called 1 month rolling contract is actually and big con and on their website and all the marketing material it is advertised as 1 month but in actual fact once you cancel they are guaranteed to get 3 to 4 months payments due to their BILLING cycle. It’s all a con but they have done a good job protecting themselves with the T’s and C’s that tiny no one can read, so well done Tesco Mobile you are officially A Legal CON"

Their network is crap all the time. If you ring them to complain then they will say maybe you are not in coverage area even you are standing in middle of the Dublin city center.Avoid them.

After signing upto a 24mth contract with Samsung J5 2016, within the year it started having problems where it would randomly jump to the camera and open other apps. To avoid being left without a mobile while away in the UK for a holiday, I rang and booked the phone in for repairs and received a repairs bag in August. I sent the phone for repairs at the beginning of August and after a week, had had no response so chased it up. After a couple of tries I finally managed to talk to an engineer who stated the phone had internal water damage. I was shocked, from the day I bought the phone it had been in gel case and there has been no damage to the unit to date. The Tesco repair department (which is an independant body) stated was wrong with the phone, verbally and told me if it was not feasible to send a report, email or confirmation of the phones issue in writing for a second opinion and even though I was still paying a monthly contract, I also was not covered by Samsung warranty as it was classed as water damage. I did not agree with the findings, and asked to be put through to Tesco customer services who politely asked, had I used the phone in the shower, in the rain etc etc. and that they understood my frustrations but it was upto me prove to Tescos, that the phone did not have water damage when I purchased it. So before you use your new phone, it is up to you to check there is not internal damage to your new phone which could effect it, in the future.Luckily I have managed to still use the handset as the issues were intermittent, until my contract ended or I would have had a big bill, a broken phone and had to buy a new one.I will never use tesco mobile again. The process to actually speak to a member of staff is painfully slow at the best of times, this evening it has taken 28mins to get through to a second department and through two sets of security checks to cancel my contract. Let this be a warning...avoid like the plague...every little helps...no Tesco doesn't."

The next day it was announced that they would give 2GB data back to their customers...again this is not good enough seeing as I spent £15 in error for a fault of theirs! I called them via their customer service number and was told that because I had used 2GB of the data bundle they weren’t going to refund me anything!! I asked them to charge me for what I’d used and refund me for the rest..they still refused “because it was a bundle I added and not them”....Disgusted is an understatement, I’m absolutely fuming!

I am furious beyond belief and I will not back down, I took out a contract for my daughter on her birthday in March 2018, all she wanted was a phone, which was used at home under my supervision. A month later we found that the SIM card was not being read, and after calling and complaining I had a replacement card sent out, which arrived in May, some time between the middle of May 2018 and July/August this sim stopped working and we never really knew it had stopped working because my daughter only ever used her phone at home, using Wi-Fi. Until she went to the park with her sisters just 30 seconds from my house and was being ridiculed in the park by local horrible kids and tried using her phone to call home as it was meant to be a safety line, only to find it was not working and she was left feeling alone and deserted.  Now I understand it's not Tesco mobiles fault that kids are nasty but your bloody devices don't work which has put my child in a very difficult position. In early September I called in to complain and a lady spent 37 min on the phone to me explaining that I needed to take the device to my local Tesco who could arrange to send it away, I eventually took the device to Tesco mobile early October and was then advised they actually do not do this. So the young girl gives me another number to call, to arrange a jiffy bag or courier pick up. Eventually I sent it off only to now hear back from the Tesco repair centre saying they had found moisture on the mother board, the guy said 'it might be rain or condensation'. I assure you this device has not been anywhere near water as I have been monitoring it. It was on up until October when I took it to Tesco mobile and then stayed in my handbag.When I challenged and asked questions the guy over the phone said they are not accusing me/my daughter of damaging the device, however they cannot repair it due to this and I would have yo pay for an additional device to be sent out to me. I have paid for this device for 5 months and had no use out of it, the initial conversation I had with the Tesco lady was not even recorded. There was no notes, I am not paying another cent towards this contract, and when I told the guy over the phone I hadn't taken the phone out of the house prior to posting it, he had the cheek to question me and insinuate that perhaps I got it wet in rain, they also sent me 2 emails saying they have tried to call me numerous times only to find the number they're trying to call is the number for the mobile phone which they have, by this point I was absolutely fuming at the level of incompetence and level of absolute disregard of following instructions as I did provide my mobile number as a point of contact, seems they are incapable of following simple instructions or even reading. If Tesco mobile think they are going to palm this device off as water damaged meaning they're not responsible for replacing it, they have another thing coming. There is a malfunction on their device and it's a manufacturing fault,  I have worked in the mobile industry in the past and I am very well aware of how things work, of its too much of a hassle. I promised my daughter a mobile for her birthday and I made the biggest mistake of my life by getting her a Tesco contract. What a bunch of incompetent agents who can barely follow any instructions. I have 3 othercontracts with O2 and have not had a single issue. I shall be taking my business elsewhere once I get this so called contract cancelled.I have raised the complaint further and I have recorded times and dates and durations of previous conversations with Tesco customer services. I assure you I am not paying another cent towards this contract and I will be looking at the finer details of the contract as I believe you have now broken this, my child has had nothing but disappointment with Tesco mobile, I will also be contacting the mobile manufacturers regarding the supposed 'moisture' damage which they can't tell where it came from. I will never again use Tesco mobile and I will not be recommending them to anyone, absolutely unacceptable service!"

On the packaging for the SIM card it states for £10 you get 3GB of data, 500 minutes and 5000 texts. My daughter thought as this was pay as you go this would last a long time since she doesn't use her phone very much. To her shock when she opened the SIM card the inside of the packaging states this is only valid for a month.. Since when did Pay as you go have a time limit. I have Pay as you go with O2, topped up about 7 months ago and it is still valid. I contacted Tesco via their contact by email page twice, no reply on either occasion. I contacted Tesco Mobile by phone, their resolution to this issue was to put my daughter onto their pay as you go lite and top up with £10. Since my daughter has used very little of the data, minutes and texts she does not see this as very satisfactory. I agree with her she should have got what the packaging stated you got for £10 ie 3GB data, 500 minutes, 5000 texts minus what she had used.I suggest to Tesco mobile to change the outside of the packaging and clearly state this lasts for 1 month."

He said Tesco were going give users a data credit in January no help to me because my phone only does calls and texts.  He then curtly referred me to Tesco's terms and conditions without offering an apology or adequate explanation. I always judge a company by the polite or impolite way they handle customer complaints and inquiries in this instance Tesco's stonewalling ""customer service"" falls well below expectations. Customer service!!!!!!!!!!!! in this instance I really dont think so. I will be looking for another mobile phone provider. If your thinking of using Tesco Mobile my advice is think and think again. I would like to think Tesco will respond to my complaint however I am not counting on this happening."

After some shopping around I found that Tesco mobile had some really good deals, I took the plunge and everything has been smooth and easy. No issues with signal or customer service. I was apprehensive since Tesco mobile is not in the top 4 well known networks. But what I have found is that they far exceed the others in terms of service and value. Mass physiology suggests that people will go out of their way to write a bad review and rarely take the time to leave reviews about a positive experience. I had a good read of previous reviews and found them quite amusing. People moaning about the recent 02 network outage knowing Tesco and others use that network. Demanding compensation and such. Grow up. It’s life. If everything in life was guaranteed every day of the year then the cost of living would be unmanageable. Top marks to Tesco mobile."

I received a text from 34060012 'thanking' me for subscribing to a service which I most certainly had not. The text said I would now be charged at £4:50 per week (64055). On checking my Tesco Mobile account, this had already been charged.I called the 'customer care' number to be told they could not refund the charge and I would need to contact the originator - a company called Mgage who handle high volume texts. They in turn said I would need to contact their customer Nexgen Ltd (A company that is dissolved!). There was a London number listed to phone which diverts to a foreign answering service who would like my details!! They gave an e-mail address for Jammitup - I won't hold my breath waiting to hear from them judging from the scam reports for these people.All these names and numbers are well documented via the internet yet Tesco seem to think there is not a problem allowing charges to be made to their loyal customer accounts.The amount in question is only £4:50 but it should be MY £4:50 and shows what sort of value Tesco Mobile place on their customers."

The phone died and I contacted Tesco who sent a Jiffy bag which was duly sent back to them. Over 3 weeks later I received an email stating my phone was on its way back and I had accepted their quote. I called customer service to check this as I hadn’t received a quote, to be told that both statements were incorrect. In fact my phone has been sent to Apple to be repaired and if they can’t  fix it, they will send a refurbished device (the Apple guarantee is 1 year, and Tesco 2 years, I was told). Why has it taken so long to communicate anything to me and why was the information incorrect? Also, surely if the device is faulty through no fault of my own, and the Tesco warranty is 2 years, I should be sent a new replacement device. Terrible customer service and communication; when my contract runs out I will definitely go elsewhere."

Yes great but if you're in the middle of a contract then you are paying for the old one and the new one - nice money making scheme Tesco!!!A poor decision by someone at the top not to allow flexibility like this, especially when other providers allow it without hesitation........Rest assured that we will be moving away from them at the earliest opportunity!!!"

I got a new contract phone with Tesco in October, it came with a broken charger to start off with and a constant intermittent fault where I can't sent texts, make calls or use data, on top of that I can't receive calls or texts either. I've been strung along by customer services for months with the constant promise of being let out of my contract if I jump through their ridiculous hoops. In the end they were having none of it saying that it wasn't their fault and demanded I give them my phone because it must be the phones fault. After days without my phone Tesco have confirmed my phone is 100% fine as I said it was! THEY STILL WONT LET ME OUT OF THE CONTRACT, OR TAKE THEIR PHONE BACK, (Bare in mind they can see that my phone doesn't make or receive any calls on most days, not through lack of trying)+++ THE ICING ON THE CAKE THEY WANT ME TO PAY THEM £182 TO LEAVE MY CONTRACT OR CONTINUE TO PAY THEM MONTHLY FOR A PHONE THAT CANT MAKE OR RECEIVE CALLS!absolutely disgusting behaviour.

Yesterday it stopped working, screen is black, cant charge it or turn it on. I googled and tried the hard reset and that did nothing so i took the phone into the store i bought it. The girl informed me that they could send it off for repair and i would take 2 weeks, i said i cant be without my phone for 2 weeks so she said that after the first 30 days if i want it replaced i need to take it to samsung, i have full insurance but still no offer of a replacement while mine is fixed. I rang tesco mobile when i got home and said i was unhappy and that my contract and credit agreement was with them. They agreed and put me through to the insurance department who i was assured would sort this out for me, they hung up. I rang them back and explained and was told a repair was the only option and its not covered under the insurance as its a technical fault and still within warranty. If i had dropped and smashed it or lost it they would have replaced it. As it stands i have no phone until i can get into Samsung tomorrow. Tesco mobile in store, phone and insurance department are all useless. My advice is if you want a mobile phone go to a mobile phone shop."

Apparently this is quite common according to customer services. It never happened to me once when I was at Vodafone. Customer service team themselves are difficult to get hold of and invariably uninformed and unhelpful.Officious and laborious 'security question' process which includes customer service agents requesting your private bank account number, which I would have thought is illegal.

Instead of upgrading my own phone, I stupidly took out a separate contract for an iphone8 for my daughters birthday. Unless my own data is reinstated I will be sending it back, its after the return date but couldn't care less. Am heartily sick of phone companies holding us to ransome with threats of poor credit. I called customer service to have my daughters number moved and her pay monthly sim cancelled, you would think i had asked for the earth!!  Disgusting service. Was passed around and after 42 minutes asked for a manager who sorted it out in under a minute. V lazy call center staff. On calling to discuss the data issue, well what a waste of time!!  A manager was supposed to call me back yesterday but nothing. Please do not waste your time with the chat, it is an Indian call center, and, as usual, they do their best to frustrate so that they have a reason to terminate the call.

Think there was only a couple of places in rural Scotland where reception was non existent when I was out and about, but otherwise super 4g coverage everywhere else.- Great value PAYG Rocket Packs.

Reading all the posts and ear-bashing staff recieved on Facebook, I left my post with my thoughts on the matter....I wanted the staff to read something positive during that time and there was someone sympathetic to their woes during the outage. Sure the outage affected me also, but it was hardly the apocalypse happening was it? Give over.........""To all the staff at Tesco Mobile,thank you for keeping us updated on things that - for all intents and purposes - were outwith your control. This was O2s problem and I can only begin to imagine the ear-bashing you must have received over the past day or two, but hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel and things can get back to normal.I understand that it is impossible to have 100% uptime on any network.  Your network works brilliantly 99% of the time IMO and I've never had a problem until yesterdays gremlin appeared.  People never make an effort to compliment operators when things work smoothly 99% of the time, but boy, they are quick to demand the CEO's head on a plate when things do go wrong 1% of the time.  I don't expect compensation. I'm not going to throw my dummy out the pram and threaten to go to another network provider. It's just one of those things that do very rarely happen. Life goes on.

Pause 2 mins on holdThe lady then come back and said i would get a phone call the next day 5th January 2019 from. The administration team to take payment and get my phone out to me earliest SundayI didn't hear nothing by Saturday afternoon so I called just to check I was getting a call the gentleman then also confirmed I would get a call before end of business day however that was not the case move on to Sunday morning 6/01/19 I call up tesco insurance again asking what had happened and had to reexplain the situation to them. This was very frustrating and delaying so I asked to speak to a manager and I did a gentlemen called josh he took the call and I had to explain the issues again sigh faceThen once all done that he said he would talk to the administraton team to get information to take my claim forward and call me back with respect he did call back however more bad news betrayed I was told that I wouldnt get a call back from that team untill today 7/1/19So fast foward to 12noon today I recieved a phone call however before we even discussed the claim. I was informed that I was not authorised on the account to discuss the claim how ever all previous times I called starting on the 4th January I cleared security each time however I had to get my grand father to call up and give authorisation for the second time I could talk about the accountSo fast forward that was sorted I call back and confirmed I could discuss the claim So as we are proceeding to the claim they now tell me I had a form. To fill out and it needed to be posted or emailed however I had no way to get this back to them for reasons so the manager I dealt with today Ian said he would look into this and give me a call back within 20 mins which did not happen so I ended up having tk ring back myself to get an explanation however when I rang up I was told yes the form had been override yet the phone I was suppose to get tomorrow is now suppsodly out of stock okay but it was in stock right up till this morning now its goneSo the gentleman I spoke to adviced me Ian was currently trying to get a list of phones that was compatible to mine I even said I'm not bothered what type of phone and Said be happy with a tempory one untill the other was in however I have been informed it's not as simple even though his a manager he can't give clearance hmm okay strange one their so I said i will call back for undpate at 7pm tonight 7/1/19 which I did to then recieve more news that the warehouse was still having issues from outside of them to sort a phone and I should recieve a phone. Call by 8:30pm tonight sorry its now 8:10pm.already so I highly doubt I will hear from them and they said if no phone tonight definitely tomorrowI just want to say I've never been so disappointed with a service like I am with tesco mobile insurance the staff are not trained correctly told me my grandfather called up on the 4th January but 100% he didn't tried telling me. They told me from the beginning the phone was out of stock another lie thereI have been continuously fobbed off every phonecall I've had with them and it's getting beyond a joke now so after putting my claim through tomorrow will now be day 5 of this problem still with no show of a phone untill whenever I just want to say anyone thinking of going with tescos I highly recommend that you don't the staff are rude and they clearly don't know what they are doing and the managers don't even have any clearence in their own team!

First of all, at the first attempt I was on hold for nearly an hour then someone answers the call, without even saying hello just hang up on me. Secondly, I was on hold again for nearly 29 minutes when manage to speak to customer service agent called ""Kalaam or Kareem"" whose attitude was so rude and no sympathy was shown about the complaint I was talking about. I asked to escalate the call to his manager because he cannot resolve this issue which you can understand where and what can happen, He put me on hold for nearly an hour and I had to hang up coz I cannot keep holding just to hear from worst customer service without any good outcome. I am regretting to have been a customer of this Worst telecom who cannot offer any help to their customer service, in fact, worst customer service I have ever experience with, This is not the first time I had but every time I spoke to them early or before always had a bad day.

I took it to the omudsben I sent all the proof of my payment details and direct debit. Tesco are saying the direct debit is inactive, now that is not my fault I was told it was all set up. I have the proof on my account showing my payment details, all I wanted was an apology and good will gesture of £10. No they can't do that! So when all 4 contracts are up in this house we are gone! Your customer service is absolutely disgusting, you do not care about your customers. I made 2 payments off my own back due to your mistake! But no you are blaming me want to set back up the direct debit well I don't think so!!"

Their Twitter team is also very responsive and will point you in the right direction if you’re not sure which department you need. I have signed my daughter up with them as well. I don’t intend to change my mobile provider any time soon

At no point was she able to access the online billing. After numerous calls she decided to leave and Tesco agreed to waive the termination charge as the online billing never worked.Now (after having left) they have said the termination does apply and they have passed the info to a debt collection agency!Unbelievable.2. From your response below you state that if Customer Service had agreed then then the payment would not be due.  However, ny wife has already called Customer Services and they have stated that they did NOT agree to waive the charge.  Just be clear, the only reason for leaving was that Tesco Mobile was not fulfilling its contract.  I note your offer to contact via Social Media but feel that we have already spent too much time on this."

I couldn't even call a customer support. I call them from another phone and they said that they noticed my phone is used out of Ireland. I use my phone for business purposes and I travel a lot so my business stopped and it has a major impact on my business. But, that is not theirs problem...Also, all my balance is locked as well...I'm switching to someone else even it cost more...Tried to sort it on FB chat, tied to email again... they just flipping me in the circle..."
5c589dd897afa10548d86692,2019-02-04 20:17:28+00:00,,,1,"I wish I could give 0 stars. In November last year, I decided to switch over to Tesco Mobile because they had seemingly great prices, and were voted best for customer service. In fact, my boyfriend and his family use them and have had no issues. I went online to order a phone, put down the payment and then realised that it had no options to put in a delivery address and had automatically assigned my billing address. This was annoying since I don’t live there, and I checked with the online chat and they said there was no way to change it. So I decided to go into the nearest store and explained to them what had happened. They said okay, we’ll call up and cancel the contract and then you can buy a new one in store. I agreed, and that’s what we did. They called on the in store phone, explained and then I went through security and was assured that the contract was cancelled and I’d receive a refund. I paid for another contract, all was well. Two days later, a phone shows up at my billing address. I call up to find out what’s happened. I explain that it was a surplus phone and should’ve been cancelled, because I want to keep the one I’m using to call them on. They say okay, the contract wasn’t cancelled but they will cancel it now and send a return package which I can then use to return the phone. I say okay. A couple hours later I go into the city centre and realise that I can’t go on the internet or send texts. I think that’s weird, and have a sinking feeling in my stomach. So I call up Tesco again and ask what’s going on, and they say they’ve cancelled my contract. I’m understandably unhappy, and even more so when I’m then told they can’t reactivate the contract and ask me if I’ll buy ANOTHER one, bearing in mind I’ve almost paid £100 so far. I say no, and we talk for a while and eventually agree that once the one phone is returned and I’ve gotten a refund, which he assures will happen in a couple of days, I can then return the other one and use the refund to take out a new contract. As a goodwill gesture they switch the one phone to pay as you go so I’m not without a phone at all for the remaining few days. I’m not thrilled, but I think okay, fair enough. A week passes by and nothing. I call again, I explain the situation again, I schedule another return pack. More time passes. I call again, explain again, schedule another return. More time. I call AGAIN and this time when I explain the lady on the phone says “we can’t send out a return pack because the phone has find my iPhone turned on. You need to take the sim out.” I tell her the phone is in the sealed packaging, has never been taken out of the box or turned on or even touched so it can’t possibly have find my iPhone on. She tells me that I need to go in store, get them to verify this, then call up and tell Tesco, and THEN they will allow me to schedule a return. By this point I’m past the 14 day trial, but she assures me I won’t be charged because it’s their error and I’ve clearly been trying to return the phone. I eventually manage to get the return package, and by now it’s around the 20th of December. I also receive an email asking for nearly £500 per phone. I am distraught, and immediately call up and ask what’s going on. They assure me, they will NOT be making me pay, I will not have to pay a penny, and encourage me to ensure there’s no direct debit on my bank. I do this, and hang up thinking that’s the end of it, I’d return the phone, get the refund, return the other phone, and finally get a phone and put this all behind me. But of course, no. I drop the phone at the post office, and carry on with Christmas. I know I probably won’t get the refund until January because...it’s Christmas. I get email confirmation that they have received the phone. Brilliant. On the 2nd of January I do some googling about how long refunds generally take to process, and decide to give around 2 weeks before calling up and asking. On the 18th I’ve heard nothing so I call up. They tell me they’ve received the phone, they’ll process my refund since for some reason it hasn’t processed and everything is fine. The guy was pretty rude to be honest, too. After about a week I ask on the online chat how long refunds take. They say usually up to 10 days. I see a few people online say it’s been more like two weeks. I’m pretty upset to be honest, by this point. I’ve not only paid for two contracts, but also had to top up a few times. I’m not in.A few days later, which is last Wednesday, I then find out that they’ve automatically passed my account onto debt collectors because I haven’t returned the one phone.  I call up again, really not happy, and get told “oh yeah, it’s automatic and there’s nothing to be done about it. Return the phone and then YOU contact the debt people and tell them the debt needs to be handed back to us.” I am a twenty year old - I don’t know the first thing about contacting these people. I also want to know why they haven’t written off the debt like they told me they had. I tell them this and that I’d been told NOT to return the phone until they had refunded me. They said to ignore the letter from the debt collection and that the refund was processed. I said it wasn’t in my account but they were adamant that it was. I told them I’d check again. Which I did. There is no transaction on my account from Tesco mobile aside from the two upfront payments for the phones. I’ve then been unwell, at uni and work and so I decided I’d call again this week on my day off and if they were still unhelpful then I’d just return the phone and call it quits and mourn the money and time I’ve lost because it’s not worth the stress. Then tonight I receive an email from this debt agency demanding I call. I google just to make sure it’s legit and sure enough, it is - and has a terrible reputation for being intimidating bullies that will essentially stalk you. So now I am scared, stressed and can’t stop crying. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I’ll return the phone without refund and call it quits but I’m not paying them a single pence more. I’m devastated, disgusted and if I knew anything about legal proceedings or had any money I swear to god I would sue."

Also no problems with taking calls and text messaging.The only problem I have with Tesco (and I'm assuming O2 since they both use the same network) is the internet data connection. In certain places I am not able to connect to the internet or the internet is very slow. The places this happens is normally in very crowded areas (like Westfield or football matches) and sometimes where major construction works are happening. So I thought the reason for the bad connection was because of where I am, but all my friends using their phone (with a different provider) in the same type of places have no problem with the internet. So it must be because of the quality of Tesco internet.Unfortunately because of the lack of consistent internet data quality, I am thinking of switching to a new provider."

I am never able to make a proper phone call without it dropping/sounding choppy.

Because I have only used my allowance in Spain for 8 weeks they are now charging a fair usage policy which was never discussed at purchase. In fact when I took out my contract & informed the sales person they gave me a list of countries where I could use my allowance & never mentioned this. Even though I mentioned that I travel extensively. Also due to a tesco error they gave me an extra 2 gigs for one month which as I am in Spain will have to pay extra for the privilege.

I am on the home strait of my fourth 2-year contract with them.While service was once very good, this contract has been a big disappointment. I have been misinformed on several occasions about policies, had a terrible experience in the Tesco store while purchasing the phone, and recently have been sent round the houses while trying to make a simple enquiry. I was interested in an early upgrade, so called Customer Care to ask what this would cost. Was advised to call the upgrades team once I was in a position to go ahead, and was advised I would receive a discount (a note was left in my account).When I rang the upgrades team the following week, it was a very long call (all I wanted were some figures), and no discount was offered. I did not make the purchase. I called back the following day, to pass my concerns on to the Customer Concerns team. Once again I was passed to the upgrade team, the call involved a couple of holds and took over half an hour. The conclusion was that a message was left for Customer Concerns and they would call me back at a certain time the following day.They called me back later than promised, so I missed their call. They left me a message, and I returned the call 5 minutes later, as requested. Customer Care did not want to pass me to the Concerns team, and the gentleman I spoke to tried to deal with the issue himself. After 15 minutes I asked once again to speak to Customer Concerns, and the assistant was not available by then. Surely he should have tried straight away to connect me to the Concerns team. Later on that day, I called in for a PAC code. I know it will cost me to leave the contract early, but sometimes the best way is to cut your losses. Again this was a 20 minute call. They are making things unnecessarily long winded whenever I ring up. They do not get straight to the point.I do not have any more patience to speak to them over the phone, so I have expressed my concerns in writing. Time to look for an alternative now!—---------------------——-----------------------------Since posting my review I received a further call from Customer Concerns. The Customer Concerns rep was very defensive, unhelpful and quite rude.--------------------------------------------------------On a visit to a Tesco mobile store (Handforth/Wilmslow), I heard to rep swearing while dealing with another customer. So I did not bother speaking to him.Online chat is useless. They do not seem to know what they are talking about, and the person I chatted with apologised for the inconvenience I (yes me) had caused!Nobody told me during my conversations that I could have upgraded my SIM only tariff free of charge. All-in-all, I am not inspired by their customer service."

Beginning of this year I began having problems with the phone, forever freezing and becoming unresponsive, Can’t text and can answer 1/9 phone calls, won’t turn off so have to rest it every 10 minutes as the problem became that bad! So I rang for advise which they advised me to send my phone in a Jiffy bag to be fixed as it was a hardware problem and I still have my warranty so it would be fixed for free. The network must have been down that day as I couldn’t order a Jiffy bag online so I went to nearest Tesco store for a lady to try order one for me, which she rang the repair team for me to book it in and explained the condition of my phone. Bare in mind I’ve always had my phone in a case so the lady over the phone explained my phone was in GOOD CONDITION No scratches, no cracks, marks no nothing only a ring around the back were you could clearly see the phone cases left a ring mark on the back. Anyway, Fast forward a week I received a phone call from customer care absolutely adamant that I’ve sent my phone Damaged! I did try argue with the woman over the phone that the phone had no damage what so ever when it left my house in this ‘Jiffy bag’ but she wouldn’t have non of it! So I rang back 20 minutes later to be told I’ve damaged it (apparently) I’ve no proof unless I have pictures of it before I sent it (why would I even think to do that?!) and I no longer had warranty so I had to pay £270+ for a replacement or I can fix the screen myself then send it back and still be charged £200+ for them to repair it. So I’ve been send back a phone in worse condition than it left and it’s still broken! Just seems very suspicious I’ve seen so many reviews the same. Funny as well that nobody mentioned the condition of the box they received and only thing they could think of is ‘damaged in transit’ for all I know someone at repair shop could have dropped my phone and passed blame. Either way not happy at all nothing’s been resolved, my phones ready for bin, and I can say 110% once my contract is up I’d never ever get another phone from Tesco. Definitely wouldn’t recommend!"

Starting from the beginning I admit to being a little irritated but explained my understanding of my complaint. The Tesco Mobile representative listened and actually acknowledged why I felt aggrieved. She offered what I had been originally promised and added a loyalty bonus as I had been a customer for several years. When I received the confirmatory email I was very pleased to note that they had increased the deal from what they had offered over the phone. To be fair to Tesco Mobile I understand that mistakes happen but the way I am treated in order to overcome the problem matters more. Thank you Tesco Mobile for treating me fairly, hence this update to my review."

I wanted to try a sim and the Triple Credit tariff Tesco Mobile is a pain You can't top up online without setting up a direct debit - you have to go to a shop or a cash point, Also when you do get it set up you don't get the rewards. The triple credit tariff was applied on activation I chose and yes I got £40 extra for topping up £20 but that got swallowed up quickly - I never got the 5000 SMS so I am keeping the sim as it's a good number but it won't be something I use often. Ironically the H+ I got before I topped up was faster than the 4G after! - if you can call 3mbps 4G I was going to transfer from my current PAYG provider but as they are serving up 50-100mbps most times I just can't - so the extra cost is worth it."

The supposed free credit doesn’t last as long as you are lead to believe it will. The customer service is rubbish and I wish I had left them years ago instead of just conveniently topping my phone up and failing to see how much I was being ripped off. They send you texts to remind you to top your phone up constantly though never send one to say thank you when you have. This is a mobile phone company with very little to offer. Try their online chat and you’ll soon find out, because if it’s not written on a card for them to read, the person or computer your chatting too can’t answer and will just  keep repeating the same thing. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."

I phone  back to have to go through the same ordering process from scratch and once again my card is declined.  I am then told I have to provide a second card number and passport number for checks. This took nearly half an hour and then go through the ordering process for a third time. Card declined again and am then put on hold again.  The whole pitiful transaction took nearly two hours.  I ask to be put through to the complaints dept to be told there isn't one....well Tesco mobile, you definitely should.  Am told that a manager will phone me back in the next couple of hours.

After about 18 months the phone refused to charge and found from googling that this was a common fault.  We took the phone into a Tesco Mobile shop in Altrincham and purchased a new phone with the intention of having the phone repaired under its 24 month warranty.  It was suggested by the shop manageress that it would be quicker to do this via a Samsung shop.  We never made it to a Samsung shop so went back just before the warranty expired to Tesco Altrincham where the manageress inspected the phone and then advised that the repair procedure had changed (she phoned the repair dept to check) and we had to go online and request a returns envelope.  This we did returned the phone, only to get a call from the repair department telling us the phone had a crack in the glass (which it didn't) and that the warranty was therefore invalid.  I advised there was no damage to the phone when it was sent and that the shop manageress had seen the phone before it was sent.  They refused to contact the store for confirmation and asked that we go into the store and ask them to call repairs.  My wife called in at the store however the manageress was at another store and was telephoned by the shop assistant to be told she wouldn't be in until Monday and to call back.  So on Monday my wife called back only to be told that the manageress didn't remember her and had never seen a phone, she ignored my wife and wouldn't discuss the situation.  The phone was subsequently returned unrepaired with a crack on the backplate.  No point buying a phone from a company who manipulates its staff so your warranty is invalid.  Buyer Beware"

When creating your online account you need the SIM in a phone so you can pickup text message authentication codes. (to initially setup the account I can kind of understand this) Even though I am using the SIM in a MiFi dongle and so have no access to the text message authentication code. You also have to create another account external to Tesco mobile so you can top-up. At which point it is very confusing as they ask for bank accounts details and won't let you proceed until these have been entered and then unbeknown to me its then setup some kind of AutoTopUp. I then received an email stating a direct debit had been setup and money would come out of my bank account a few days later and when I contacted Tesco mobile, they said thats not correct and they couldn't see anything and no money would come out. Yet lo and behold, they take out £20. I ring tesco mobile and speak to the rudest customer service rep I've ever spoken (a guy called Tal) to and said I set it up and it's my fault, completely talked over me and refused to put me through to a manager or the complaints dept. I doubt Tesco are interested however, I am no reviewing everything I have with Tesco, which admittedly in the global scheme of things a few hundred quid spent at Tesco's every month won't bankrupt them , but my money is good anywhere and perhaps ASDA or Morrisons, will treat me with a little more respect than the Customer Service People at Tesco mobile will. I simply cannot believe how awful Tesco mobile Customer Service Reps are and how bad the online part of managing your mobile is with Tesco mobile. Shocking in the extreme.UPDATE:-So Tesco do a generic reply, which is fine. What isn't fine is the fact I am not on Facebook or Twitter. I think it's great that a mobile phone provider doesn't provide a phone number to call regarding complaints. Just gets worse and worse"

I expected it to be replaced but they said it had to go for repair. I am amazed they could not replace or at least lend me a phone until it was repaired. One of the staff said I should have had insurance and was dismissive. Apart from the face that all of us cannot do without a phone I explained I had to have one for calls and sat nav as I am a volunteer with the Welsh Ambulance service. They said I would have to wait for a jiffy bag - this took place last tuesday and jiffy did not arrive until Saturday - why could not the tesco branch have a jiffy bag - now waiting for return but do not know even if it has arrived for repair -today is a week later i.e. tuesday - absolutely shocking and incompetent service - is it a ploy to force one to buy another phone? - If something goes wrong under a year you expect a replacement - nothing in the contract to say this is tesco policyyou would think a mobile phone company would know that we cannot wait for weeks without a phone! john roberts

When they sent the phone back not only did they not send it back in the original box they sent it back bubble wrapped and unboxed. They also sent it back without the accessories and now I can't use the phone at all as I can't open the sim card tray to put the sim in as the device needed to do so has not been returned. I rung the call centre yesterday to explain the situation and they said a member of the concerns team would ring me back today. I gave them an alternate number to ring as they can't ring my Tesco mobile number as I can't currently use it. I rung the call centre to ask why the concerns team hadn't called me today only to be told that they had rung earlier, but the number they rung wasn't working! Sure enough they had rung the Test mobile number that I can't use due to not being able to reinsert my sim card! Now I have to wait another 24 hours for a call back from the concerns team, that's if they actually ring the right number.I'm actually in a worse position now than when I first contacted your customer service team. Not only do I have a phone with poor call quality, I now can't even use it!

The only reason ive give 4 star instead of 5 is because ive never been able to send picture messages even tho i have data and the other reason is when i did phone to cancel they said my security question failed but that is the right answer and ive used it for years i even logged into my account ok and the security question was the one i answered .

I only run a fairly basic smartphone, and don’t need phenomenal data packages or any bells or whistles. Of course, Tesco do a range of tariffs, but I’ve stuck with £7.50 a month since I joined them, and I get a new entry level handset every couple of years. On the very rare occasion I’ve had a problem or a question, their customer service staff have been responsive and helpful. I contacted them on Facebook this morning (Good Friday) with a small query and had an answer within a couple of hours. My previous contact with them (a delivery issue) was in July 2013!"

However, there is a welcome message from Tesco Mobile when disembarking from the aircraft at Havana, the service is limited to ""receive only"", but text messages can be sent and received.I am baffled if there is no roaming agreement, how is the Welcome message generated?  This long-standing problem (at least 3 years) must annoy the multiple thousands of Tesco Mobile customers who visit Cuba each year. I understand that Cuba is not the only country with a ""can't make calls"" service, but there seems to be no prospect of a full service in the future."

Looking on here this is an all too familiar story...We have been customers of Tesco Mobile for over six years, with no problems. Sadly, any system is only as good as when you put it to the test. It is unfortunate I cannot trust Tesco Mobile to take care of my phone when I send it to them, or to stand up to their responsibilities.I sent them a phone, still in warranty, in good faith. It had a battery charge issue, but now has an additional screen problem. They are refusing to repair the battery fault until I pay for a new screen.The company has admitted that there was no damage to the packaging, and there was no obvious external damage to the phone. The 'internal' damage was only 'discovered' when the phone was opened. I therefore conclude that the damage could only have been caused by them as we have never opened it, and there were no problems with the screen when it was sent off.I believe I have been more than reasonable in allowing them extra time to investigate, but I feel nothing has changed substantially. No more information has been forthcoming. They are still refusing to carry out the warranty repairs. I have therefore requested that they send the phone to me in the same condition I sent it to them.If when I receive the phone, it is not in the same condition, I reserve the right to take further action. I have also asked for a 'deadlock' letter and copies of all my phone calls.I have repeatedly asked for more information on the damage, but  no effort has been made to get that. They have just repeated the same things over and over again.When I initially requested to be put through to a supervisor an attempt was made to put me through to the complaints department, despite the fact I had not raised a complaint at that time. This resulted in be being kept on hold for yup to 15 minutes.I believe there has been an amount of obfuscation on their part. Until pushed, they have only ever offered me the options of; paying for the repairs, having the phone returned, or paying for an upgrade. I believe they deliberately withheld the information that I could escalate the complaint, I had to call Customer Care to hear that.There was misinformation too. I was told the screen was cracked, that was then retracted.And there was poor record taking. I was told twice, by different people, that I had been offered a 25% discount when no figures had been discussed. I had declined the option of a discount when it was first raised.I am unhappy that they have refused to carry out the work I requested under warranty until I paid for the repair to the damage.I hold there was no such damage to the phone when I sent it.I believe the repair centre is a third party providing a service to Tesco. They told me that in changing mobile providers would make no difference as I would still have to deal with them if I need repairs in the future. Maybe so, but at least Tesco Mobile will not be getting any more of my money.I realise I will ultimately have to pay for a new phone. I do not want to, but it has never been about the money, it was about the principle. I have lost all faith in Tesco Mobile. My intention is to move all my custom away from Tesco mobile as soon as practical, without paying a premium.Please do not put that twee little message saying you are sorry and contact us on Facebook, you have had several chances to resolve this but just don’t care. If you would like to contact me you have all my details.POSTSCRIPT Don’t even bother complaining to the Ombudsman or Tesco, they don’t care. The contempt these people hold their customers in is unbelievable!The Ombudsman rolled over when Tesco Mobile told them it was a ‘broken handset’ agreed, THEY broke it.Tesco refer you back to the jokers at Tesco Mobile complaints. I give up, I wish I had never heard of Tesco Mobile!"

And then offered me a deal on a newer phone. The customer service has always been very understanding of my mental health issues and allow someone else to talk on my behalf after a confirmation of who I am, some companies won’t even allow that.They have always been helpful to me whenever I’ve conversed over live chat or through DMs. I would recommend to friends and family but most are already with Tesco Mobile 😆"

Please be aware, that when you take out a monthly contract, the money you pay a month in advance, does not cover the month coming. Your next payment covers the first payment period.  Effectively, the money you pay for what you think is your first payment, just disappears. Tesco were unable to explain it properly. I feel robbed.  The O2 network they use is good but Tesco should be ashamed of their underhand practices. They have joined the rest of the Globalists."

5cc224c0a843690a7cc9f4f4,2019-04-25 21:21:04+00:00,,,3,I find that the data usage you get with Tesco it much less than with other companies. I supposedly used 1.5 GB of data in less than 2 days just by occasionally using it to go on social media. I tried contacting customer service via the live chat but the representative was extremely rude and cut the live chat off. I would not recommend purely because when I was with EE I never ran out of 2GB of data yet with Tesco I have 5GB and seem to use it within 10 days and I have no clue how...

The fraudster had my password, the prompts suggested by Tesco mobile to get your password are weak and easily researched - mothers maiden name, place of birth, fathers first name, etc. As I understand it, they didn’t succeed at first as another simple security question was asked...this  information was apparently provided by Tesco mobile to the fraudster when asked on their second call 5 minutes later. Then armed with all the information needed, a further call 5 minutes later led to a successful SIM swap to the criminals which led to £11,500 worth of fraud from my credit card account in 24 hours. And what was Tesco Mobiles response..all security processes were complied with.  On looking further, it seems some other phone providers have much more rigorous systems in place. This is really not good enough in the modern era of identity theft. So, the message for anyone thinking of using Tesco mobile is think twice, until they tighten up their security procedures around SIM swap. It could lead to some serious fraud from your finances."

There was no refund! So I've rung Tesco Mobile and a lady I spoke to said she has processed my refund so I should get it by next week and she did apologise.What annoys me more is that I have an ongoing card bill with Tesco Bank who are chasing me for a payment which is fair enough but when Tesco Mobile are holding my refund that doesn't matter."

Tesco sent him a lovely phone but it's on PAYG, not contract as requested via Tesco site on the internet. I am certain I ticked all the right boxes. The SIM is likely corrupted from the Motorola, as well as the phone itself becoming unusable with several faults, so we just expected to be given the same number and start the new contract, Huiwei and new SIM. As he paid £44 for something, I thought it was the outstanding balance on the old contract for the old broken Motorola that he doesn't want anymore? He needs this resolved fast, losing work and unable to contact anyone at all. I'm working away from home so it's awful having no contact with him.

This company is no longer personal and refuses to help their customers. Stay well away.  - in store team are lovely but failed to place a buffer on my account as requested. As advised by tesco customer service on the phone. - I have unwillingly spent more on my bills per month than previous years- tesco have blamed me for the error and told me I removed the buffer online. Contradicting the first comment. - upgraded my account and advised would be active after midnight that night.- used more minutes after upgrade, only to get a message 3 weeks later to say I had used all my minutes. - told by customer service I was wrong about the start date. Asked for call to be listened to.Offered a £3 bundle to give me more minutes for the remainder of the month. This would be refunded if my compliant was correct.- call was supposed to be listened to and called back within 48hrs. I did not receive call. - I called back 4 days later, to be advised that call had not been listened to yet. - received call back within 24hrs and advised i was correct and information i was advised the advice from tesco was wrong.- Offered 500 minutes free as an apology and £3 bundle to be refunded. - complaint escalated and offered £20 as a good will gesture. Refused as this was terrible service and want to leave tesco mobile. Now in deadlock. - received bill this month and have been charged for the £3 bundle. - called customer service again to complain, advised a call back within 24hrs. 17th May at 14.17- received call from tesco mobile over 24hrs later on 18th May at 17.41. Unable to answer phone due timing. -:called today and received £3 refunded as requested and unable to escalate again due to deadlock. Tesco have treated me appallingly and also financially benefitted from me spending more per month on my bill over the year. If i want to leave they are wanting me to pay them approx. £150 as i am still in my contract. I wish I could leave but I do not have the money to do so. This company has really let me down and refuse to end my contract so that I can leave unless I pay them. After the way I have been treated I think this is the least they should do."

Three days later Tesco reduced the price which amounted to £108 over 3 years. As I was in my ""cooling off"" period I rang customer service and was told to wait until the 9th of May my contract change date and take the phone back to store where I would be given a new contract and phone. On returning to store I was told I needed to bring in my original receipt or they couldn't do it.  I could not find the document he was talking about and I am very careful about retaining documentation, I therefore rang customer service again who advised I could log into my account and get all details. Upon returning to Store they contacted customer service the phone was returned and I was told I would need to return to store in 24 hours to allow the cancellation to go through.  Upon returning to store today my account wouldn't activate, they contacted customer services and  I was told I will have to wait until the 9th of June!  The lady in store said she was not told this and had never known it happen before.  I asked to speak to a Manager at Customer Service and was eventually told someone will be in touch in the next 24 hours!

HELP? 02037403517”I have never subscribed to any of this services and as I was already charged £4.50 I called Tesco mobile to explain why £4.50 was added to my bill without my consent and authorisation. I was told that nothing they can do and that I have to contact the scammers directly to get my money back. I also was told to look for the contact details of these scammers by googling them as Tesco mobile did not know the company which added extra £4.50 to my Tesco Mobile bill. Therefore I think that Tesco Mobile is affiliate to these scammers and are happy to add the money to your bills as they must be getting bonus from them. The customer service is appalling and very rude. Despite online searches reveal that ‘Games4Mobile’ is scam I was still blamed for the £4.50 charge and advised to contact scammers directly. What a professional approach to scam by Tesco Mobile? I hope I will be able to leave Tesco Mobile as soon as my contract ends as I do not accept that they facilitated white-day robbery by well known scammers to their new unaware customer. Shame on you Tesco Mobile! Please avoid this network as fire.

See Tesco response below which Tesco seems to automatically give every bad customer review.Does it make any sense for a company to promote bad reviews on FaceBook and Twitter? Why doesn't Tesco ask for my mobile phone number, examine Tesco Customer Service poor record in my case, and then contact me with solutions to the above problems? Instead, Tesco demand I waste more time posting to Facebook? This is an example of the growing inefficiency (Time wasting) of large organisations like Tesco. Are Tesco's directors aware of this? Is such inefficiency the reason Tesco is more expensive than its competitors?"

I have signed a credit agreement and passed all checks, however I have found that I was refunded first payment day after and when I phoned up was told that  this was cancelled due to ""security reasons"", I was not even notified about this. Now after phoning back to referred department they could not explain why it was cancelled and told me that someone will contact me and place the order manually, but never came back to me. I am absolutely disappointed.On top of that I have received an email from Tesco on 10/05/2019 stating that I have not signed my agreement and it was therefore cancelled, which is not true.

I contacted the customer service line to inform them of the situation. They said I had to contact Huawei directly. I said that I bought the phone from tesco mobile, not from huawei.

TESCO need to be more flexible with their packages to suit the end user. Unused DATA  should be rolled over in my opinion. This is what other companies are doing. TESCO Mobile Marketing need to address customer concerns if they wish to be leaders. This needs to be fixed.

When I reported this again I was told that as my phone had a small crack it would not be covered in the warranty and that it would have to be sent off for 3-5 days to even get a quote. I pay nearly £50 per month for a phone that is barely usable regarding the network. When I mentioned this I was abruptly cut off the chat with no explanation. Not impressed at all with the network or customer service. Definitely will nott be staying with Tesco unless something is sorted on their part.

I get text reminders if I am running out of data, and when I dropped it in water, it took one phone call to sort and I had a new one sent through the next day.

Got charged £75 for a screen repair only for the phone to be sent back and within a week the back come off. It was repaired using double sided tape! Sent phone back to be fixed to be told it was unrepairable. They no longer have the phone in stock and unless I pay over 300 they will not cancel my contract. The only other choice is to take a phone that is of lesser quality and not even the same make. I am only 2 months into my contract so don't want to accept a phone that I don't even want. Tesco believe that providing me with a month off my contract is 'more than generous' compensation for a problem that is their fault.

Unfortunately it was stolen 3 weeks after I received it while I was in a shop but having bought insurance with the phone I have now received a new one.  I felt ashamed having lost it so soon as I've never lost a phone before and I never felt anyone going into my bag so it was hard to believe it had happened but the people dealing with the claim were wonderful and I now have my new handset.  I highly recommend getting insurance, I nearly didn't buy it but I'm so glad now that I did.  I'm very happy with Tesco!"

Service is also average at best on contracts are crap compared to what else is available UPDATE - standard response from Tesco to look good on here. Already contacted Tesco and spoke to several people, including the below. They do not want to help at all. There words 'we can't keep crediting you back if it's an ongoing issue'. So they can't get right, and for this reason the customer should be expected to foot the bill. Well done Tesco, please don't insult me by replying to this telling me your sorry and want to help.

I've been a customer for over two years and on recently trying to purchase a second phone and contract, this was fouled up by a staff member and it's been a nightmare trying to get it resolved (and it's still not resolved).Yesterday, I was on the phone to the sales dept. for forty minutes (I've spent hours on the phone in total) and I was put on hold and just left there!  It's also impossible to speak to a manager, and even after I was told THREE times that a manager would phone me - no one did. Just appalling. Most worrying, is that it doesn't seem to be too bothered by this dreadful, pitiful service.  My phone is a lifeline as I’m housebound and I am now very worried about losing the number by yet another ‘mistake’ by Tesco. As far as Tesco's repeated responses here to negative reviews about contacting its customer services,  I would strongly dispute there being any merit in doing that. I consider its attitude is one of unreliability and disinterest. I would definitely never recommend it. I expect to be lodging a complaint with the Ombudsman next month as there are so many 'loose ends' that I cannot get closed, or  corrected."

I gladly told 2 old dears to avoid them whilst the salesman was in the back getting them a phone each!!My handset is now worthless, all the online buyers are offering £10, it cost me £160!I don't care what they think and say about updates, they even emailed me last week saying it would be fine until April 2019...that past ages ago!! The phones will not be getting anymore updates whatever they say and security will be at risk.They don't care about customers and are still flogging soon to be dead handsets.I will be leaving them immediately and they can whistle as far as I'm concerned. Tesco has been going down the pan rapidly in every way. No online website, no pc sales, nothing at all in a world of technology.Goodbye Tesco, there are plenty of other mobile providers out there.Update...

When the 2-year contract ended on my elderly relation's Tesco pay-monthly phone, Tesco did not inform my relation of this fact and automatically renewed the contract for another year.2. When the third year of contract ended, my elderly relative requested Tesco Mobile unlock the phone so the phone could be used with another network provider. Tesco repeatedly gave the wrong unlock codes and said they would request more unlock codes from the phone manufacturer and would contact my relative in 6 weeks time. (Manufacturer's do not provide more unlock codes, but this was unknown to us at the time). Tesco did not contact my relative 6 weeks later.3. Two months later, my relative contacted Tesco Mobile to find out the situation. This time Tesco said to send the phone to the Tesco Repair Centre and if they could not unlock it, they would send a replacement phone. A few days later Tesco notified my relative they had received the phone and it was locked to a different service provider and they had returned it in the post. (Tesco did not state which other service provider it was so-called locked to).4. My relative protested about this. TESCO WANTED EVIDENCE my relative was correct: My relative said they were in possession of their Tesco contract documents and could also prove it by contacting the other service providers if necessary, who would obviously state they had no contract with them and could have this put in writing and sent in emails to my relative who could forward the emails to Tesco!!! TESCO BACKED DOWN.5. Tesco said to return the phone to them again and my relative would have to request this service after they had received the returned phone and was not permitted to request this service beforehand.6. On receiving the phone and contacting Tesco to ask them for another Tesco return, Tesco wanted to know the security question relating to speaking to Tesco Mobile over the phone to them. My relative could not remember the question. My relative would have instantly remembered the security answer, had they been asked the security question from Tesco. So no return was accepted.7. My relative contacted Tesco mobile again. Someone else answered the phone and authorised the phone to be returned to the repair centre again.8. Have received a message from the repair centre, stating yet again that the phone is not locked to their network and they are returning the phone again: A copy of the phone's receipt was included with the phone when it was returned for the second time to the repair centre. Naturally, Tesco also authorised the phone could be returned. I am contacting Trading Standards about this matter.9. I did not contact Trading Standards, but decided to make another phone call to Tesco mobile. I told them I would swear at them and call them anytime I wanted to, in order to swear at them again. The support agent seemed to be genuinely helpful and not particularly due to my threat. He said Tesco's previous behaviour was completely unacceptable and pointed out Tesco did not have the purchase documents for my relative's phone. He requested to see a copy of the receipt documents for my relative's Tesco mobile phone, either in the form of a pdf file document or a jpeg file (photo file). On receiving this information, the support agent said the matter would be dealt with as a priority. He told me to use an email address: tescopop at ingrammicro dot comAlso, he said it should include the Tesco reference number in the email 'Subject' heading - the reference number Tesco originally gave me when they accepted a paid-for return on the phone. He said he did not need a written summary of what had happened, but my relative sent one, as follows:My Tesco Samsung Galaxy ** **** phone has been sent to the Tesco Mobile Repair centre on two occasions - both authorised by Tesco Mobile Repair centre. On both occasions Tesco Mobile Repair centre has stated the phone is locked to another network. I include an email attachment with this email of a copy of my receipt of my Tesco Samsung Galaxy ** **** phone. This receipt is proof of my purchase and indeed the phone is certainly not locked to another network. I wish for the phone to be unlocked and returned in good working order or to have a replacement phone which is unlocked and in good working order...A few days later my relative received a replacement phone which was unlocked and in good condition. Miracles do happen!The support agent was excellent, but myself and my relative will not be purchasing absolutely anything from Tesco again, not unless there's not anther store for many miles and the purchase is for something very simple, like some food."

It is absolutely dire and the service was awful - you will be better off making sure your home insurance has mobile devices covered as you will pay a similar excess and get a brand new phone with zero hassle. My experience summarised:Insurance sold in store verbally as you will get a new phone of you damage yours - reality is the small print says new or reconditioned. We had three reconditioned phones sent to us across a period of a month that were all faulty and not fit for purpose. We had to get a Samsung Engineer to email them to tell them that it was a fault with the phone and how they had reconditioned the phone. I even sent them a video of the issue as I was getting no where being bounced around their call centre where no one would take ownership of the problem. A summary of the unhelpful advice we received was (even though the problem was theirs as they sent fault phones) - take it to your nearest samsung store, ring samsung, buy a ten pound phone to cover yourself while we are dealing with your issue (6-8 weeks to deal with complaints I was told), i'll order you fourth phone then your case will be escalated and looked at by someone else!!!!!After around 6 weeks, countless calls to their call centre having to repeat everything as they do not assign you to a case manager, spending well over 20 hours on the telephone to them, tesco mobile and samsung (who were excellent) and visiting tesco mobile in-store about 6 times I got fed up and asked tesco mobile in-store to take ownership of the problem and get it sorted. In the end they said we could have a new Samsung A7 but at this point we had lost all faith in the phone and tesco mobile protect - the instore assistant was great and spent over an hour and a half trying to resolve. We ended up having to cancel down the existing contract, paying £150 upfront (but this would be refunded across a number of months) so we could start a new contract and get a new mobile that would actually work - fit for purpose. Worst service I have ever received. Then the Tesco mobile protect complaints team rings me two weeks later and says we have reviewed the case and we will give you £55 compensation - what a slap in the face - thats all they valued all the time, effort, stress and hassle we went through in trying to get this sorted across 6 weeks and all the hours we wasted. I told them to keep their money and I was not convinced in the slightest they will make any improvements. On top of this they didn't know if the fault we had with the three phones we had from them was just limited to us or affecting other customers - since Samsung told us it was a fault with the software I think others will also suffer with their service and failure to take ownership of the problem and put the customer first - had we not persisted I can tell you this would still be going on. Do yourself a favour and take out another policy with someone else or just use your household insurance.I would not recommend and will never use again."

What they don't tell you is once your data allowance has been used, the charge is 25p a megabyte so the £2.50 is quickly used up. If you run out of data it's much better to pay a few pounds for a one off data bundle. For example an extra 500MB costs £2.50. Whatever you do don't increase the safety buffer as this gives you only a very small amount of extra data. I found this out the hard way."

I generally dont feel the need to complain about many services but this needs to be addressed. My direct debit got cancelled (because I gave the bank the wrong info apparently, this is a dd that has been running for over a year! But still, my fault) they then didn’t tell me the dd was cancelled, I spent time trying to get through with no luck, then had to suffer aggressive collection techniques bullying me into doing what they wanted. If they told me the dd was cancelled it would take two minutes to see what was wrong and set it back up, but they couldn’t do that. I just get misleading information shepherding me to pay my bill, which I did, I cleared my account (on now 4 occasions) hoping to get it back up and running. They send me emails saying it is back up and running and the dd is in place, it says so on my bank app, but they still fail to take it. I’ve now just had another aggressive letter off them demanding I pay by card (again). I did set my dd back up on the 4/5th of June and they applied to take two previous bills they said they couldn’t take (insisted that I must pay them manually by card because they can’t apply for them by dd) less than 10 days after the dd was set up. It’s a catalogue of problems not to mention the trading standards issues they have breached with the bully boy tactics and misleading information. The next reply after here will be Tesco saying how sorry they are to hear of my plight and could I contact customer care to resolve, well I have and they are bullying me to accept their £20 goodwill gesture or else go through the ombudsman service. To date, Tesco mobile has cost me a lot more than £20 and made me feel like I’m being bullied to accept their answer is the right answer and they have the money and the resources to make me accept this or it will cost me a lot more than it already has. The last letter I have received from them was bordering on a threat to do so. All I have done is pay them money after money to keep the account active and all they have done is mess me about and threaten me. Vulnerable adults keep away. Don’t go there! Just go anywhere else but Tesco mobile."

Apparently she stopped the direct debit from the contract as when she went to her bank as she did not know why this money was being taken, bear in mind she never used this mobile contract as she forgot she was sold it. Long story short my father died so I took my mum to live with me. I finally get chance to visit her property and there is demands for payment regarding the contract and a moorcroft debt recovery letter for the grand sum of 15 pound. I decide Tesco are a reasonable company and I will phone and I will explain, so we can sort it between us without involving a debt collection agency , wow was I wrong. I had the misfortune to speak to a gentleman called Shah. I explained what the issue was and he didnt care one jot he told me it doesn't matter if your mum has dementia she has to pay moorcrofts directly, I asked to speak to a supervisor, he said none where in on the shift, I asked for shays full name to complain, he stated he didnt have to give me that information and hung up. I emailed the chief executive after this, but he was, of course, to busy to respond. So the chief customer relations employee responds, bear in mind my mum cant remember my name, and I have explained her mental health problems, NEEDS TO KNOW my mums security password! SERIOUSLY!!!!!! OBVIOUSLY I CANT PROVIDE THIS SO HE CLOSES THE COMPLAINT!!!!. I had no choice but to tell mum what she had done and what was going on, my heart sank as she looked petrified and asked if' the big men from Tesco where coming to hurt her. Heartbreaking. I paid the moorcroft debt agency myself. Please stay away from a company that treats people with a terminal condition, as dementia is, so abhorrent. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!Please note I personally have a Tesco credit card, mobile contract, and use Tesco groceries and I have threatened to the executive relations manager (still waiting) to transfer my credit card, and mobile contract, use a different grocery firm and cancel my mums pay and go phone with a competitor unless this is resolved. Shareholders take note why Tesco is losing money.!!!!! Ridiculous.

Got a message from them that I had exhausted the 200 minutes, so I disabled the 200 minute/30 day plan and tried to order a new one, but they won't let me. I have to wait until the 30 days are up. Morons. So I can't use my phone. I called them and they said they can't fix it and referred my complaint to their technical team who never bothered to do anything to fix the problem. Chat line guy was rude and seemed not to understand the problem. Seemed stupid and indifferent and not interested in trying to fix the problem."

My case has finally been referred to ‘Concerns’  team - I clearly spoke to someone in the ‘not a bit concerned  Team’ instead. Worst customer service ever - now going to take my custom elsewhere. Update - phoned another network provider on Sunday- new phone arrived today (Monday). Managed in 5 minutes what Tesco mobile couldn’t do in more than a week!"

I was charged £100 for going over my data by 500mb. This is a riddiculous amount of money as adding a bolt on for the same amount is significantly less. Their customer service team do not really make much of an effort. They don't seem like they want to make their customers happy or stay with them. I will be leaving as soon as my contract is up. I have never had these kind of issues when I was with 02 before. And if I ever ran over the extra charges were generally minimal. I would not recoment Tesco Mobile to anyone regardless of their deals are better than others.

It does not show on the phone call log and my son does not know anything about these calls or even what country it is. Tesco mobile customer service were no help. It took some time for them to find the calls, on two dates, then all they could say was they were made from the phone, despite me explaining they weren’t etc and didn’t know where they were to etc. She then said she would discuss with Manager. No change in response. I asked to speak to the manager but was not allowed to. The only solution was that I should remove the safety buffer making the phone only usable for inclusive contract calls, data etc. Incredibly unhelpful. I told her I had googled the number and it had been reported by others as appearing on bills but no calls made by users. Would not listen. Very very disappointed in Tesco. Not prepared to listen or investigate."

And to say the least I am absolutely appalled with the lack of customer care and control they have over the company. Two days ago I started having trouble loading the internet when connecting to wifi. Wasn't problem with router as other devices were connected, forgot network and re logged in, reset network settings, turned phone on and off and still wasn't working. Rang and spoke to customer care who asked me to try forgetting the network again and it then started to work. The following day the problem persisted, I called customer care again which at this point they advised me to take it back to the store and get a replacement as my warranty wasn't up and it would be better to get it looked at as soon as possible. Due to busy schedule and relaying massively on my phone as I need it in order to work and to access money. I took the phone into the tesco mobile store the same day, the women was helpful, called customer care and explained the issue with the phone and she was happy to replace it. Went over some security questions, the lady in the store brought out a new iPhone 6s out of the back, checked mine included everything it came with and proceeded to go ahead with the replacement. Towards the end of the call the lady in store seemed to be shocked as she turned to a colleague and say 'she's cancelled the contract'. She then ended the call advised me to reset phone and being none the wiser to what had happened I did, she then continued to tell me that the lady on the phone had cancelled my contract meaning she would be taking the phone and I would have to pay £20.99 in order to take a new contract out with them. I had no phone to access my money, no way to contact anyone, no way to work as I need my phone in order to do so and told there was nothing they could do but if I wanted to take it further gave me the name of the women who cancelled it with no explanation as to why she did. I drove 6 miles to my brothers work to use his phone to call to speak to someone to try figure out what had happened and they said the same thing, there's nothing they can do without the money and said they would refund my original payment of £20.99 but would take 3-5 working days to go in, and I still had no phone. I said I would like to take it further and they said I would get a call back from a manager and I've still heard nothing. My phone is my only way to work through my agency and apps and will get turned away without it, its my only way of contacting people and access to money. If I had another phone to use I wouldn't of taken the contract out in the first place, the whole ordeal has been stressful to say the least and I'm just really disappointed."

But a few hours on, and we've now (apparently) used up our 4GB data!!! Which is impossible.So I contacted them hoping they'd say ""yep no problem we're aware and fixing"". Instead I did get acknowldgement that there's a problem, but it was evasive in terms of what's caused it (and therefore whether my problem was covered and would be fixed). I asked where i could check status. No response. I didn't bother asking to be called back (no point in setting off on the wrong foot now is there)We are now both without any data, rendering the service utterly useless.Oh and the top it off, mine and wife safety buffer has completely been used up.Sort you act out.

I purchased a phone in jan 19 and because I did not have a receipt they will not fix the phone that is clearly a manufacturer fault! They take your money pick the phone up for repair knowing full well I did not have a receipt then back track and tell you 'oh that's my colleagues mistake, we cant fix it afterall'!! Abysmal customer service, you buy their phones and they break and they have no service in place if you have lost your receipt its just a slammed door in your face! Absolutely shocking and never again will I buy any type of electrical product from Tesco ever again! Giving people the run around and wasting peoples time and money is all your good at!! In this day and age you should be able to track transactions without getting the customer to keep contacting clubcard ect when you know full well they cant issue statements more than 6 months old!"

On 1 August 2019, I dropped my phone and cracked the screen and asked if I could claim under the insurance only to be told that I wasn't insured for my present phone  and the Insurance premium that I had been regularly paying was for the old phone lying in a box unused somewhere!I have had my 3rd upgrade and have taken out new insurance but beware - Tesco phone assistants do not always make this information clear in their anxiety to make a new sale."

I took out a cheap little Doro phone to use incase of emergency and within the first 2 months the screen went dark I took it back to them and they fobbed me of saying its a nightmode that saves battery % so I though brilliant! That's helpful then 3 days later my screen went totally black and couldn't use it. I took it back to them and when I took the phone out the bloke asked if I wanted to cover the phone for extra cost which I agreed to but when I went back to the store a different bloke was in and I asked him to send it of for a repair and he said he can do but it will cost me I said wait.. What!? Its covered though and he explained tesco doesn't cover phones like Doro as its a cheap phone..... So what the heck was I paying extra for!?? So I had to cancel my contract and take out a 2nd phone that was more better and up to date and also which had cover on.... They then billed me £200 for the Doro phone when realistically the phone is only worth £25 if that! And within 6 months of using my new phone guess what!! Playing up again! So as I had cover on I went to a different tesco store as I wasn't happy with the other store I was going to and they turned around to me and said there's no cover on the phone... APPARENTLY! They never put it on when I took out my new contract even though I specifically asked for it and i said can I cancel my contract the bloke said yes but you'll need to pay £100 I thought fair enough that isn't bad so I paid the £100 canceled the phone and............. 1 month later I got a bill for cancelling for £650!!

I explained I wanted a blue iPhone XR but I’d previously had a terrible experience with DPD as I live in Dorset and the depot is 40 miles away. The last time DPD tried to deliver my phone I missed them and it went back to the depot. So I asked for another solution such as delivering to the local Tesco Mobile shop. He wasn’t sure do I asked to speak to his manager but he went off and spoke to his manager and fantastic news I could click and collect from the local store. So we went through security and got put through to sales. I explained about the manager and click and collect, but to my surprise I was told you can’t do that ‘mate’ we stopped that a year ago. Firstly I’m not his mate and more importantly someone was not telling me the truth. I then asked to speak with customer service again and I got put through.

I would not have bought the mobile without this arrangement. The vouchers were paid up front when the mobile was purchased. I have just called Tesco mobile for the 4th time to Tesco mobile having discovered that they are still taking monthly payments directly from my account. They have had 4 chances to honour the contractual agreement and failed every time. Based on my experience outlined above, I would strongly advise people to avoid Tesco Mobile."

I'm on the Top Up Monthly plan and even though I put the money on my account days in advance half the time it doesn't roll over, cuts my plan off and starts going Pay As You Go and eating up my money. This makes it so that I have to call in and get the proper plan put back on it. When doing so I've found their customer service really good as long as you call, as when i tried to bring up the complaint online via their message system the person was incredibly dismissive, told me my promotional plan had expired (even though I was told as long as I put money on it in time I could keep the promotional plan) and wouldn't listen to reason. Since these roll over issues keep happening I've decided to switch to someone else as I'm tired of having the same issue every month and the last straw was how their online customer service representative treated me."

I wasn't aware it had happened till I went in to see the two lads in Tesco Mobile at Chesterfield Road Tesco store, Mansfield, Notts, where I always buy my mobile phones. They are fab in there & deserve praise for their knowledge & genuine care of customers. They're always wonderfully helpful. After bringing down my buffer on my phone for me & informing me of what had happened, they asked me to ring 4455 customer care from my mobile for more information than they could give me in store. The young woman who answered was so lovely & exceptionally helpful. She was able to block premium rate callers from taking money from my account in the future & refunded some of the charge that the scammer had taken from my account, which will come off my next month's bill. I had certainly not expected any kind of refund! They are superb at Tesco Mobile. I cannot praise their service highly enough. Thank you Tesco Mobile very much."

They will not allow me, his wife, to deal with them directly.  They also cannot swap the contract into my name unless I set it up from scratch again.  I am the one who sorts out upgrades or any issues, not my husband.  He and I find it incredibly frustrating.  They say the reason why he is the main point of contact is because he pays the bills.  However the bill is paid by our joint Tesco Credit card so this does not make any sense either. I have asked them for nearly 3 years to sort this out and they won't.   It is a shame they do not listen to their customers and are so inflexible."

Though they claim to have sent notifications to phone and email.  None were ever received.  Then they passed the matter to a debt collection company.  No prior notice, no bill ever received.  No notifications.  The bill was for a whole £14.51.  I only discovered this because the debt collection company told me.     I have complained that no bill and no notifications were ever received.  Their response well we sent them.  Our records say we did.                                     They have absolutely no interest in customers.  Nor any understanding of the upset and distress they caused, all over £14.51.  Complained to the CEO - David Little.  Who basically said our records state we sent notifications.  We will give you 1000 club card points and we are not interested.  Clearly little by name and nature.  This company is unable to acknowledge that their I.T. and staff can be fallible like the rest of the human race.  The only assistance ironically was from the debt collection company who could totally understand my annoyance and frustration, at the actions of Tesco Mobile.  Like the gentleman said 'over £14.51'I would never recommend this company to anyone.  They are clearly completely disinterested in the customer.  I also referred the matter to the CEO of Tesco - who again was completely disinterested.  Told me I was dealing with the best people. If David Little and his colleagues are the best I would hate to see the worst.  Never, use this company again."

The only compensation offered by Tesco was the equivalent of what I would have paid for the equivalent days data.

I phoned customer services within cooling off period and cancelled and told them I wanted to go on Pay as You Go as I only use phone for emergency. They refunded my £7.50 and I then cancelled my Direct Debit to them. I then received a 'final' bill for £1.35. I phoned customer services and spoke to young man called Cameron.I asked why I had been charged £1.35 he said I had used 'Data'. I said I haven't touched the phone and hadn't made any calls etc. I said I would not be paying this. He in turn threatened me saying ""if you don't pay we will be putting this  into the hands of the collection agency"". I was furious and said you call yourself 'Customer Service' put me on to your Manager. He said he would get another Dept to phone me within 24 hours. I asked for his surname but he refused to give it to me. I told him I would be going back to T Mobile where I have never had a problem, and I told him someone had better phone back or I will be taking this matter higher.  I NEVER received a call back from this other Department.  Their customer services is a disgrace over £1.35, unbelievable that I was threatened!!! The general public should steer clear of Tesco Mobile as their employees on customer services have no idea how to help or speak to their customers.  Carry on like this and they won't have any customers left! I would never ever be with them again!"

Problems with phone - call customer service and they say to go into the store. Go into the store and they say they're not paid to do technical work.  Really bad reception couldn't make calls couldn't get signal time after time - it was a nightmare.  Then today my phone went crazy!  Started doing things for no reason, called customer service and although the person was really friendly and nice they couldn't resolve the problem so told me to go into local store (doesn't look local at all on map - just moved house). I tried taking back off mobile but unfortunately still acting crazy.  Can't get into messages, can't make phone calls, take photographs. Its like the phone has a mind of its own - Weird!  I was given 500 tesco clubcard points for the inconvenience which sounds amazing until you work it out -  Its £5 I believe.  I want a phone that works properly, and I want a good technical department. Will be without my phone for 3 days now because I cannot get into the store. And even then they will probably send it off for repair or whatever so what do I do? I took out insurance so feel they should just swap the phone - its no good its not fit for purpose.

If you turn recurring payments off they will still keep charging you.Their payment plans look simple enough, but I had an issue where I was actually in credit and turned off my ROCKET PLAN which resulted in Tesco taking £30 a month on 11/10/19 out of my account and not allocating it to the PAY AS YOU GO mobile account. I contacted their customer support team twice now they added a £20 rocket pack to my account and said they would refund me £10. Since then they have taken another £10 out of my account on 18/10/19 and still haven't refunded me. Just sent an email to their customer support to try and resolve this on 18/10/19.Home from Home roaming is limited to 3 months after that you have to pay extra for data.

I phoned Customer Care who told me that the online order was cancelled & I would receive a refund. The next day we received 2 brand new phones. I immediately called them again & was told that they would send a Jiffy bag for me to return the unwanted phone and as soon as it was received and approved I would get £45.75 refund in 5-7 working days. It is 2 weeks since I returned the phone & still no refund so once again I have phoned only to be told that I won’t get my refund until the date that the next bill would have been generated (for a cancelled account) which will be the 23rd October and by the time it is processed I will actually receive the money on the 8th November. I have told them this is unacceptable and am now awaiting a call from the ‘Concern Team’ I won’t hold my breath.

Finally  they decided  I needed to send the phone to them for repair. Was informed  that a Jiffy bag would be sent within three to five days. It didnt arrive.  I spoke to Customer Services today.  Of  course they are ' very sorry'  etc. Now have to wait ANOTHER 5 days  to receive the Jiffy bag.  If it arrives I will send the phone  to them which will take another week at least and I will have been without a phone for over a month and I am still paying for a phone I can't use. This is the third fault in this phone in 15 months. Will never use Tesco again

They take payments twice and when you try to contact customer service they tell you they can't help because it's run by Mi-pay. They say go on the website and sort it. But then the website is down. To be honest I don't care who runs it. You subcontract the job out it's your responsibility to deal with it when it goes wrong. You're a communications company try communicating with people.

The previous samsung contract phone was on O2 and never experienced signal problems. I have moved, when old contract expired, to Tesco mobile and got 2 contracts with 2 different phones one Samsung and one Sony. Both of them I have to keep them next to the front or back window to get one little line of signal. If the phones are in the middle of the living room then It goes straight to the voice mail. I leave in London. And this is not only in my house. 10% of locations, I am mostly in London, I don't have signal. It is very annoying when you have to run a business you loose customers and money.Next contracts I am afraid will not be with Tesco mobile. Everything else is fine. But if you can't make or receive calls everything else doesn't matter."

They then contacted me saying the screen was broken & trying to charge me for a screen repair. It was fine when their staff saw it in store and when posted! Several calls later no joy, so I'm having to take them to their ombudsman or if that doesn't work the small claims court. Appalling service, obviously as soon as the contract is up, I'll be moving to a competitor who value their customers!"

No early upgrade still have to pay full bill for less than half the service. I have been told to keep paying in full and deal with problems. Go with anyone else but stay away from ripping off Tesco who care for cash not customers they don't give a damn once you have signed up waste of space.🙁🙁🙁 I can clearly see that you don't read either as haven't mentioned upgrade fee once.

Still no apologies or offers of compensation for not providing the Service they were paid for or offers to reimbursement for having to buy extra top ups when not needed Avoid like the plague they are just Time wasting money grabbers that offer a crap service and Non existing customer service.And happened 6-7 times over the last 12months.Yep Tesco still not listening after their reply. The problem was you cutting the Services after new monthly data entitlement had rolled over/reset as expected each time and cutting it mid month in between payment date and your reset date whilst still being in credit with data and had not gone over the entitled amount.Stating it had run out when it hadn't or I had gone over which I hadn't either. 2 days each time no data service and then also cutting contract 3 days before contract renewal cutting data etc when I had 7-8gb left  again and reverting it back to a Pay as you go mobile.Each repeated cut in service at the same level at about half of my monthly data usage allowance????????Like I said Crap no reimbursements??

However after spending an hour or more wandering about a poorly put together website I found 1)  I couldn't register as a new customer with email but was able to access a very limited control panel via the mobile number 2)  There were very few option on that control panel and they were difficult to understand. 3)  Since this phone is for an under 18 I wanted to make sure the premium services etc were off.  The wording of the option buttons do not make it clear if selection turns it on or off.  It is very poorly put together.Finally I tried an on line top up via Paypal.  I noticed the agreement I had to make allowed Tesco to take payments when required without authorisation.  I did not want to do this but there is no other option available.  This smacks of shady practice.  The payment was not accepted anyway and there was no plain English comment about the reason the error occurred, just that there was an error.I'm pretty sure in terms of cost the SIM free is cheap and convenient but the web interaction service with customers is abysmal.Please change your data services provider.========================================Update following your reply.I do not use social media.  Not everyone does.  Nor do I ever intend to.  In fact, I find it very strange that the only way your address problems is via social media.As to your points, you miss my point that the website is poorly designed.  You say there are many reasons why the online top up failed.  Well then, produce an error code which explains the reasons in plain English.  This should not be too difficult.I have no intention of linking any debit or credit card on a Pay as you Go SIM.  It would appear the only option available is to advise my son to buy a top up card for 10 pounds at a Tesco store.  Hopefully this will be easy but you did not suggest it as an option.I repeat my previous comment that you need to review your Data Services Provider.

I did not set a safety buffer and shortly after this I went to Turkey for one week. I must have accessed the Internet for a few minutes and topped up my device. When I arrived back in the UK I contacted Tesco Mobile as I was experiencing problems, only to be informed that I had incurred £108 of roaming charges. I was also informed that I has set a safety buffer at £100. This is untue, I would NEVER set a safety buffer for more than £30. I complained to customer services and received a letter today stating that although I didn't set a safety buffer limit at the time of signing up, Tesco had applied it against my number. It doesn't make sense. I was also informed that despite Tesco sending me text messages to warn me about the roaming charges, whilst in Turkey, I ignored them and continued to use the Internet. Loads of lies because I always use Internet cafes offering free Internet whilst abroad. I did not receive ANY texts notifying me that I had raked up roaming charges. I have text messages on my device sent by Tesco giving breakdown of CHARGES I would incur whilst abroad BUT there are absolutely no messages warning me of the roaming charges. Tesco have made a decision and state the charges stand but I don't agree with that. I will be taking this to the ombudsman to investigate. Do NOT TAKE OUT A TESCO Mobile CONTRACT.

Took me 8 days to sort it. Once up and running on 8/10/19 I started using my phone. I then noticed my data was running down very quickly. I had 15mb and never used this in the 7 years with another provider. On day 13 I noticed I had used 8mb of data in 5 days. I work full time and only use phone in half hour lunch and when I'm home I'm on the WiFi. Called Tesco was told that's how much I had used and this was being used while my phone was in my locker but I told them that my data was turned off And this was impossible they told me to do a test I was told to turn my data off completely when I'm not on WiFi, however I have never done this with another provider. anyway I did this and someone was due to call me back in 7 days. 7th day came and no call back so I checked on my data and I'm now on 11mb of data and this is on day 12 of being with them almost 1mb a day which is crazy. So Called back and guess what yep I've used it. I raised a complaint 3 times to the resolution centre and only one someone called me back and said nothing they can do it's been used. After much complaining they allowed me to leave with no charge. This was a sim only. There was many issues in between like broken promises but the main issue is they have problems with data being used. I am now with EE and have been with them 15 days and only used 4.5mb of data. I've since called Tesco and told them and I have now been refunded my initial payment and also the 10.00 I topped up when I left and went to pay as u go to keep my number and not incur fees to leave. I was promised call backs and they never happened. All I wanted was someone to investigate but no one was interestedI would not recommend Tesco mobile"

Was told by the fraud department that companies globally can see your password when they bring your online account up to check or change anything for you. Personally I think that is a lie.

An easy mistake to make - maybe. But Tesco customer care are putting the blame on me for not noticing the mistake on the contract !I feel totally let down by a massive company who’s customer satisfaction is supposed to be important to themThe only positive was the attitude and attention shown by the phones manager at the Tesco store , who himself could not believe that nothing could be done"

Ever since moving to Tesco Mobile I have not been able to ring them, just get a voice saying the number is not available. After contacting Tesco to help me with the problem, and made to feel like it was something I was doing wrong, I dug my heels in and they finally admitted that that part of Canada is not available to ring on their network. Vancouver Island has a population of 3/4 million people, with 2 major cities. It is not a remote place. I think this is ridiculous with technology today that this is happening. Phones in the 1960s worked better than this. It took a lot of hard work on my part to get this information from them, and they have avoided putting it in writing to me. I also feel that many of the Tesco staff are not aware of this which is not good."

I contacted them via- Online Chat which, by the way, is Amazing and works on a Sunday; so I contacted them and was given a 'free' switch to a new allowance allocation which is exactly what I want. The result? saved me from going to another company to have a secondary sim for Mins or Data, now, Tesco M delivers everything I need and this is the second time i have contacted them—they always do their best—you will be treated professionally and the terms and flexible, fair and just.

A few days later, the SIM still wasn't working. I called Tesco Mobile again. They apologised and found that the IMEI block was still in place, and this would be lifted within 24 hours. 2 days later and the SIM still doesn't work. Called them again to find they didn't remove the block and had no explanation to give me. They apologised and promised the block would be removed within 24 hours.

Tesco sometimes offers free calls/texts/data now and then, and never had any problems what so ever. Up until RECENTLY.I wanted to upgrade my phone and change my tariff so I get lower calls/data/texts a month for a cheaper monthly contract, with Tesco. I spoke to numerous customer service staff, on different occasions, and they all said that this was absolutely fine and I wanted to pay around £25 a month, which they also said was fine and I’d get the upgraded phone for free. They didn’t tell me the phone contract it self is included in this price, so the wording is terrible and I double checked over and over. I didn’t want it being more than £25 WITH the phone contract payment monthly also! I am useless at stuff like this but this is why I continuously rang up asking my questions to which they were confirmed.Some staff are rude and don’t even speak good English.I’ve cancelled my contract, I’m not staying with Tesco as I got cheaper in Carphone Warehouse, I get told I can pay my contract off now, and pay my early redemption fee, and didn’t say I’d still have this month to pay. I thought I had to pay £97 right now.The man put me through to a lovely girl, and no I have to pay my months bill and the £97 in January!

I am not a customer, nor will I ever be one.A very quick overview:A friend of mine was in a marriage that included an extraordinary amount of abuse. Physical, mental, sexual and financial. 3 years out of this relationship and bang. Tesco mobile and Lowell send a letter to her telling her the debt for a contract she never had, had been sold to a collection agency. I ring tesco to ask how I go about helping to deal with the situation  as my friend suffers with Anxiety and depression disorders and would find the process incredibly troublesome. I was told she could ring and leave permission for me to discuss on her behalf. I eventually managed to get her to build the courage to do this, for her to be told she could not. The customer advisor for Tesco Mobile put through a fraud claim (the ex took out the contract without her knowledge) and advised that they would ring her on Monday 2nd December after 2pm. This person also refused to note her permission for me to discuss the account on her behalf. I ring up and question again why they would not allow her to do this since I was told she had to for me to discuss and i was given an apology and told to get her to do it again and surprise surprise she was told she couldn't. 11.30am fraud attempt to contact my friend. No voicemail left. The call was attempted again on Tuesday 3rd December before 2pm again but on this occasion my friend was able to answer. Tesco fraud department stated, in a nutshell, tough! We've sold the debt and we aren't willing to investigate. Before I rang Tesco originally on 29th November, I rang the police to report the issue and to receive a crime reference number. They refused stating that my friend was not the aggrieved party, Tesco were as they are the ones who have been defrauded. So, Tesco have been defrauded and I suppose under their risk management structure..... emmmm..... let's just sell this on and forget about it.... and the person who it has affected the most. Their unwillingness to show compassion or support or even just something as simple as, ya know what? this is rubbish..... let's investigate it...... it's disgusting. No GDPR issues if permission is given.I was told that if we were in the same room when making the call there wouldn't be an issue in me taking over the call if permission was given....... when I live in Northern Ireland and my friend lives in England...... that's an impossible task...... and supposedly against company policy..... LMFAO!!!!! I'm not finished yet... I won't give up... common sense has to prevail, surely?

That is up until my most recent upgrade.I am afraid  the current manager at the Gillingham branch features amongst the most rude and arrogant individuals I have ever met!To be honest, I accepted his rude behaviour  and tone as his odd manner, on making the upgrade, as he spouted on about my being tight and how he would give me twelve quid himself, if that was a problem!Not having all my passwords on me, I declined his offer to set the new phone up in store, saying I'll  attempt it myself, when I get home. He insisted  it was just a matter of switching the sim cards over. However, on arriving home, the first thing I read was that it could take 24 hours to revert to my new phone. I'm  afraid with my current situation (two of my siblings in hospital in the past week) my personal curcumsrances dictated that I couldn't  be without my phone! I tried several times to call the mobile shop at Gillingham. But, unfortunately they didn't  pick up and so I kept getting passed to the queue of the customer service phone  support. At this stage, I decided to abandon the new phone until my next free day, when I would go into the shop for assistance in setting the damn thing up!The next day, I received a request to provide  feedback on my recent Tesco experience.I answered that request in an unscathing, but honest way. Yesterday, I popped into the store to request help in setting the phone up. The manager was serving someone else and so a young lady assisted me. To my utter shock, the manager, who was midway through serving another customer at the other side of the shop shouted out, ""Did you complete a survey about your recent visit?' Though surprised, I answered, ""Yes, i  did?"" He then shouted, ""Well, what you put was untrue wasn't  it?' I replied, ""What bit was a lie then?"" I added, I didn't appreciate being bawled out in front of other customers!Once his customer had left the store, I asked him what he meant, by calling me a liar. Apparently, we were talking at cross purposes. Something I would call a misunderstanding and definitely not a lie!That said, he has the most annoying habit of shouting over you, when you are trying to discuss and then when you make a point, he childishly says, ""Oh, whatever"" and ignores  you or shouts, ""What did you say?""It took his young assistant to step in to silence this shooting individual!Tesco, where have your standards fallen?Bring back the old Gillingham staff, that's what I say!"

I desperately needed a phone and was promised next day delivery and after a week still no phone. I cancelled the contract and was assured it had all been handled and there was nothing to pay. I then ordered an Iphone 11 from Tesco which I am using now and am happy with. Some weeks later I’m told I didn’t return the handset (S10) that was never delivered/lost in Ireland so I was threatened with debt collectors. After speaking with the concerned management team I decided to settle the balance of over £800 (probably wasn’t a good idea) as a gesture of goodwill and so my credit score was not impacted. I was promised someone would get back to me and 2 months later still nothing. Tesco have taken my money and not given a damn about customer service or my lost funds. The actual phone reception and network is fairly decent in my area but I would be cautious choosing them when purchasing a contract.

I have been a customer for many years, and I can say after having issues with my handset (just shut down totally without warning).  I contacted the customer don't care team, and their whole ethos is make it hard for the customer to get anything sorted. I was made to feel as though the problem was all of my own making (even though it was not), and in the end I went to Apple direct and they resolved this for me immediately and in a way I would have expected Tesco Mobile to have done. I raised a complaint which was basically dismissed and told in a deadlock letter I could go to the Ombudsman which I have done. Then for Tesco Mobile to raise a query on this and state it should not be dealt with by them!! The Ombudsman just shut the complaint, so now just seems that Tesco Mobile do what they like!!I've now got no recourse and even contacting the crap customer care team on social media has not helped.I would only say please please please avoid this poor excuse for a company, and spend your hard earned money with another provider. I am looking forward to leaving when my contracts run out."

They misled me buying insurance for my daughters phone. I paid £8 a month insurance for 18 months. Then I had to pay £50 excess to get a new phone when the screen broke. Literally all I got was the handset,  no charger or box. The insurance customer service were rude. Sniggering under their breath and abrupt. When I put a complaint.  I just recieved a standard letter, saying it was in the small print. The didn't acknowledge their staffs behaviour. I then went into store to cancel phone contract. I was told it would cost be £125 as I am leaving early. I understood that due to terrible customer services went with Sky.I went back to store to cancel,  they advised I had to call from my handset. I went home and done this and they charged me an extra £77, for airtime.  I explained again that I was misled as this was not explained to me when I enquired about cancelling my contract.

I noticed I put my phone on charge last night and it didn’t recognise it - thinking perhaps it was the electric socket so I tried a different one with no difference. I immediately phoned customer care to report this who confirmed as I was within the 30day fault period that they would exchange the phone - happy days. They suggested to phone the store I purchased it from to confirm the phone was in stock. Between this point (say half hour) I was cooking in the kitchen and one of the kitchen utensils dropped on my phone and cracked the screen protector which has gone through to the original phone screen also (2-3cm) crack at top of phone - I phone the store to mention this and they said they wouldn’t exchange it!! I then phoned customer care who refused to put me through to their Manager and instead decided to argue with me on the phone, I do not want my phone ‘repaired’ when the phone should have arrived in fully working order and be fit for purpose -  i am now paying £46 per month for a phone  I can’t use because I can’t charge it!! Can someone please tell me how a little cracked screen makes a difference to a faulty product that clearly has nothing to do with the charging issue!!! Why would I want a brand new 18 day old phone repaired with an issue as big as this?  - what guarantee do I have this this will not happen again? Why should I be phone less for weeks? Not good enough for a brand new product, Tesco need to take some liability here and keep to what is stated online!! I have used Tesco mobile for seven years with two active contracts and am disgusted at the level of opposition and complete disregard I have received. May I add, now where on the contract terms for Faulty goods does it say this needs to be returned in ‘original order’ given that the phone didn’t arrive in working order, where is the accountability for what has happened? Surely some wear and tear will happen when you own a phone, regardless of this be over a period of 1 day or 18, accidents happen and mine has quite clearly of poor timing!! I have a remaining £1300+ left to pay for the phone over a three year contract, I am quite sure I am not the only customer who would be greatly unsatisfied with such a response! I either want an exchange or to end the contract, no more argumentative customer service reps please!!"

Took out a 24 month contract (phone & sim), but used my old EE sim for the first 6 months until end of EE contract. When I put the Tesco sim in, hardly has service anywhere! The service drops out whenever I enter buildings of any form, no internet access anywhere in WC postcode in central London, No WiFi on the underground.. It drops service out on the motorway when using satnav, streaming services like Spotify & YouTube are constantly glitchy, It doesn’t automatically reconnect to network when I’ve been on the tube (OR WHEN IT DECIDES TO RANDOMLY DROP SERVICE) so phone has to be turned off & on to reconnect. I complained to Tesco, said I wanted to cancel, guy told me no & said sending a new sim should fix the problem. What a load of crap. I want to cancel the sim portion of the contract because it doesn’t work at all, it’s a breach of contract as the service doesn’t do what it stated it would and what I’m still paying for! I constantly miss calls, I can’t use Facebook, WhatsApp or any social media app unless connected to WiFi. I thought the phrase was ‘cheap & cheerful’ not ‘cheap and absolutely atrocious’. Also, before you attempt to infer it; the issue isn’t my phone. I had Apple examine it, they stated the device is in absolute perfect condition and network coverage is perfect with Vodafone & EE sim (both of which I tried..)"

On Friday 17th January 2020 I went to the shop in order to buy a phone on pay monthly basis. First question i was asked it was what's nationality I am then Sales Assistant submitted all my personal data to the system and we were just finishing the order. I was asked to read terms and conditions of contract sale. He has asked if he should read them for me but I said no, I was fine to read them myself. Then another Sales Assistant standed up and asked me to read them out loud and explain every single point to him to check if I did understood what's written in the agreement. I was shocked the way he talked to me in front of other people in the shop. My adult daughter who was with me was also shocked the way i was treated. I have decided to do not sign the contract with them on the day and leave the shop. Before I left he added that I should shop online and this is the law that I should read it off loud. He has also mentioned that I won't be able to buy a phone in any other shop especially tesco provider. I couldnt understand why I was treated like that. I felt like i was racially abused and it was direct discimination to my person. I feel ashamed. I have decided to go back to Tesco to speak with Duty Manager and raise a complaint. I went there next day and when I have asked to speak to Manager he was the only person on duty that day. I have asked him that I would llike to speak to someone else and he said that he is the only senior person in the building. I couldnt belive the way I was treated by senior staff! I have asked him to provide his name in order to raise a complaint He has refused to provide any details. Also instead of speaking to me in the quiet corner he shouted accros the shop.

Also there are no longer any free calls on top-up.We generally use a free landline and Whatsapp to minimise or avoid ridiculous Tesco charges.Worse still,even when not using mobiles the money drains mysteriously.Seriously looking for a reasonably priced alternative network provider."

However, when I need them, it took 5 days for an envelope to arrive in the post for me to post the phone to be assessed. Why not hold the envelopes in store? Smacks of not caring about customer once they have your money, and knew the rest of it wouldn't go well.Apparently I've 'pressurised' the phone and it's 'damaged inside', despite there not even being a scratch let alone a crack. Want to charge more than £80 to mend, and now I have to use my insurance, pay £20 excess first and have been told I'll probably only get a refurbished phone back anyway. Even after strong emails, I'm getting £10 back but that hardly covers a faulty phone not being replaced. An absolute disgrace, right from when they choose not to bother to hold envelopes for a speedy service for customers from the start, and I'm stuck with these guys now in a two year contract. Don't make the same mistake!"

Aashita was one of the Customer Care representatives about an app which I had taken on board using it with a smart watch. I was advised to go to Tesco Mobile in store and ask for a more suitable app which would be more appropriate for my needs. A very pleasant person and nothing was too much trouble. I was speaking  with Aashita for some time and was helped immensely. A very professional person indeed.

They don't take their problems to work as they say, customer's have their own problems. I prefer to wait until they are working rather than see other members of the Phone Shop."

Ordered a new handset and upgrade to my tarrif Saturday, delivery was scheduled with DPD for Tuesday. After 5 days of supposed attempted delivery both when I was in and when I instructed them to deliver to my neighbour - no delivery made. (I've left a review for DPD). It go so rediculous I called Tesco a week after my initial online order was placed to ask them to cancel my order, because clearly I physically can't receive it. Customer service lady was lovely, but couldn't help me as the delivery and order team weren't open to speak to and it was more complicated to do without them. Please call back tomorrow. Called again Sunday customer service chap was nice, cancelled my order but said I would need to call again Monday to confirm my parcel (which I have never had the pleasure of seeing or touching) has been scheduled for return to sender because the team weren't in today. Oh and I now can't upgrade until march - what would be the point anyway, trying this cycle of madness again is not something I'm up for. My overall issue is with DPD - absolute pile of shiney sh**e. However Tesco do have a part to play in this, they refuse to deliver to anything other than your billing address, so couldnt even get it delivered to work, also on your delivery info bit it states DPD offer delivery Mon-Sat 8am-8pm, not true for me, I could only ever reschedule my delivery for a weekday and never got any say in what time slot, all my time slots were during working hours, with the later being 3:15pm. I'm done Tesco, in this day and age it shouldn't be this hard surely."

When I asked for compensation Tesco Mobile hide away and ignored me. A subsequent complaint has been dropped with lies: they said they called a number of times but they were not able to get through to me.

You think it's cheap but eventually it is much more expensive then you might have thought. So here is the story. I have a contract with them for a phone and bill pay. The data allowance is 15Gb. The phone is used by my wife and she run out of the allowance after which they started charging her 3c per Mb which means in a week or so we are 254 Euros in debt. This is 2 years unlimited data with other networks such as GoMo or Lycamobile and the coverage is much better.They've said they have sent SMS warning that she's running out of credit (still needs to be verified) but I am sure they never mentioned how much they are charging so we would have an idea.They steal from people, people give bad feedback. Their reputation is horrible and they just don't care. What is important for them is more money."

I cannot complain to Tesco either, by means of their complaint form that prevents any communication from ever being sent, because of a ridiculous error message that accompanies it saying that your phone number must be made up of numbers. Well, I haven't written it in hieroglyphics! And any alternative way of formatting it, has now well and truly been exhausted! Chat is run by anyone who can read a script, so useless technically. You can't even screenshot and then send for them to see the issues, because there is no way possible of attaching the screenshot and then sending. Tesco Chat suggests to email them over to technical support, but that will be impossible if you have to keep writing numbers that aren't numbers in the phone number field! Mad and completely frustrating. Even Tesco at Twitter won't bother answering your screenshots that you can actually send there, as they are more interested in what they'll be doing socially this weekend!I suggest, if you want a service provider that can help you, then please keep away from any company that uses 02 as its provider. It's a Spanish company, after all, where everything is mañana mañana! And nothing gets done. Tesco also has a history of fraud and hacking of Tesco customer accounts.

Be warned switching to Tesco Mobile is a horrendous experience.  I should have known, as it explained that you would be able to submit your pac code (code for porting your old number to your new sim card) at the checkout online, but there was no option to do this throughout the whole purchase.  This then left me chasing a foreign call centre to ask when I could share the code, and facing several very useless responses that it would all become clear when the sim arrived.  The sim arrived with no reference to the porting process.  I plucked up the courage to put the sim in and found details of the porting process online.  I was told it would only take 24hrs max to do this, but after 26hrs it hadn't worked, and have now just shut down the phone completely.  With no phone I had to try online chat, who told me I would have to wait 4hrs without a phone until the new number ported over.  No other phone company takes this long, it should only be a few minutes!  So now I'm paying for a phone I can't use, and wish I had stayed with O2 despite the overpriced rate as an existing customer.  Avoid Tesco Mobile if you can."

Not because they're friendly or helpful, simply because they actually show up when knowing they work for such a sh!t company.Contracts are expensive with next to no customisation. Why do I have to have unlimited texts and minutes?Phones are overpriced, as well as having a limited choice when picking a new handset.As soon as I get the money to pay off my contract I'm switching providers. You pay more for less, ending up being Tesco's b!tch.I would never recommend tesco mobile to anyone. If you're with them, I recommend doing a quick google search to find a better deal on a better phone.The website can be unclear and when topping up your sim it's deliberately vague. It doesnt tell you what you're paying for and when researching a clear answer can't be found. When running out of data, I got a link to top up online, I thought I was paying for more data only (as I'm on unlimited minutes and texts so I didn't think I'd be sent a link where you pay for more) but as it turns out I payed £15 for 100mb of data and more texts and minuets. Now tbf that's similar to other companies, but i wasn't told about this anywhere. I looked at the data bundles you could get emailed to you and saw £20 got you 16GB of data, I assumed paying £15 top up would give me around 10GB of data, so I used the online pay feature as it seemed the most straight forward. Considering that both of these options were shown to me in the same place, and that there was next to no info on the top up online page I thought it'd be fine to trust in it and pay the £15.

I have a zero bill cap and get a warning text that my data will be cut off when I reach the limit , but every month I get overcharged a few quid for using data .Last month I only used one minute of calls and sent 160 texts and used 10 gigabytes data the bill was over £14 . Internet access is very patchy even in Glasgow City , with long waits for it to reappear , certainly not dependable and very annoying .

I hadn’t dropped the handset or damaged it in any way.Despite sending in the phone with the receipt they refused to do anything about it and asked me to pay £100 to fix the phone! This is completely unfair. The receipt states they have a 1 year guarantee on all their electronic good and the Sales of Goods Act makes evident selling broken goods is unlawful.Getting through to them on the phone is a nightmare and they hide their contact details on their site.My advice: don’t use Tesco Mobile. It cost me £300 and a lot of aggro!

5e67e36e3c93ae0bc414034d,2020-03-10 18:58:54+00:00,,,1,Some of the worse customer service I have ever experience. I bought a mobile phone from them because I understood I could offset my monthly payments by depositing £250 worth of clubcard vouchers towards my monthly payments. This would be used for monthly payments until it ran out. I have now called them on 5 occasions (nearly and hour each time) to get them to take my monthly payments from the £250 clubcard deposit. Every time they have assured me that it has been sorted out and every time they have failed to sort it out and subsequently taken money from my current account. Yes I have followed every variation of complaint escalation and tried different complaint teams. I wish I had not engaged in a deal that they appear to be incapable of delivering.

Thought these guys just sell overpriced groceries, but no, I just found out over the last 4 months that also sell overpriced data! I needed a new phone in November. My wife informed me they do great mobile phone deals and we would also be able to get a great family discount. I had been with O2 for approximately 20 years or so. No problems with data or coverage, so was wee bit wary of the swap. But we were informed by Tesco staff that ‘we use the O2 network’ so all ok I thought. First month, run out of data in two weeks. December lasted for three weeks of the month. Slightly better. January it lasted for two weeks. Unbelievable I thought as I was out of the country for over a week, and didn’t even have my Tesco sim in my phone.So my data lasted a week. I then Changed my bundle to double up my data. Lasted two weeks. Now again this month has run out. My wife added £20 to my safety buffer. This lasted half a day!!YES £20 of data in a day.I’m sure the guy I spoke to on the phone was wearing a mask and his name was ‘Richard’ Stand and deliver, your money or your phone!! This is extortionate pricing.. not sure how you are getting away with this Tesco.I’m sure Martin Lewis would like to hear about this.. Hmmm!If Tesco would like to discuss this any further, please drop me a message on Facebook or Twitter and my customer care ( wife ) will do her best not to be a condescending little upstart."

Charging for 30 days while providing 6 days worth of service is also theft. I am currently contesting this but urge everyone to stay away from this fraudulent company.Dear Tesco, as I am not able to respond to your comment: I have spoken to six reps about this issue. I don't see any need to speak to another. You are the ONLY company that has tried to charge me for this, so with (zero) respect, you are lying."

The staff member even said sorry for the error but said she could not help as Customer services did complaints. Customer service said they were not interested and go back to the store. The store said go back to customer services. Wrote three emails to customer services and no replies other than thank you for the emails.The sales staff at the store just pass the buck.So do customer services so this will end up in court now.TAKE NOTE you cannot use tesco mobiles abroad without penalties in the small print they do not tell you about. Tesco staff lie about contracts and refuse to assist as does customer service. Tesco cannot be trusted and their customer service is dreadful. I have been bashing against the Tesco wall for four months and not even a decent response. DO NOT TAKE OUT A MOBILE CONTRACT WITH TESCO> YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

I am doing his shopping and picking up his prescriptions! He was very worried cause he had less than £3 on his mobile so I got hold of the number for him to top up via his phone ! ( he is not very tech savvy!) when I called him to check on him he said he hadn’t managed to do it as his debit card is different from the previous time he had topped it up some years before ! With all that’s happening Tesco has a skeleton staff so I decided I’d call and wait the extended time to get all the information required so I could help him ! So I waited just under the state’s time of half hour wait tescos automated message said the wait would be and I’m not on Tesco mobile so it cost me to wait ! Once I spoke to the gentleman who answered and explained why I was calling ! And after getting pass the security questions he explained to me what I should tell my elderly friend to enable him to try and add credit but he then told me that Tesco didn’t want their elderly or high risk customers worried and as he could see though his history that’s he usually put £10 approx every three months he told me that he was putting £10 credit onto the account as a gesture of good will !  I was totally taken back and couldn’t thank him enough for such a gesture to an elderly customer. I’m totally impressed with both his understanding and his decision to use his judgement and obviously his ability to help someone who is scared and lonely not to worry at this scary time. When I called my elderly friend it took a while for him to understand that this was a gesture of good will and he to was taken aback ! I would like to thank tescos and this colleague for making it possible to make an elderly customer both happy and safe at this uncertain time we are all facing. Tesco’s and there colleagues have certainly won my approval and vote for this and I would be happy to recommend them to anyone that asks. Thank you again

I explained the country is in isolation how can I call and he simply said ”yes, take care.” Ridiculously diabolical service, understandable staffing issues and technical problems can occur.

You can actually ask them when mobile data was enabled/ disabled. they can give exact time stamps.however, if you ""somehow"" went over that mobile data cap, itl still keep going. and going. up to 4 hours without telling you. so your 10quid safety buffer can be COMPLETELY used without you even being informed.  so you just got a extra 10 quid charge, dispite being told you had 50mb left of mobile data left on your plan. This has happend to me for several months now. its only now i got in contact with support about it.My, Assumption, since i cant possibly know, is that if you have mobile data on, and a webpage was using it, and you disable mobile data, that webpage still still use the data dispite the app being put into the background. so itl just keep charging.  this is probably the only example of when data protection is against you. they cant review what you did with said ""data"". Even with concent.  Just make sure you close every single app your using. toogling mobile means nothing otherwise. the support is great but...most of them are just gonna post a ""hey you used it all, we cant look at it, go stuff yourself"" giant paragrath whenever you bring this up.  just know it can take up to FOUR hours to update your usage on their servers."

We have home contracts, SIM only contract and a PAYG SIM.  I have had no problems with any of them.  I can top up my son's SIM from my phone quickly.

They have a good customer service team who are very helpful and do actually listen to you. By and large, they have good rates and selection of phones. However, the most competitive rates are only available on 36 month contracts which I'm not comfortable with committing to.The only negative aspect of my Tesco Mobile experience was the fact that they've had a outage at an unfortunate time for myself earlier this year. Having said that, I'm not going to pretend that any provider can guarantee against this. One outage in my three years as a customer is very good.Overall, I would recommend Tesco mobile to anyone who's looking for a mobile phone provider"

Pathetic, l am left fuming and have complained but they say l should have terminated that contract when the two years was up.they know there was no activity on that phone all this time, but the worst thing is they mingled that bill with my current so as l did not notice.I am taking this further as if there are two contracts then there should be twoseperate bills in which case this would have been picked up years ago.I’m pretty sure that is illegal.

For the first 2 weeks never even used the device as I waited on a protective case and screen protector to arrive.  First problem I discovered was being unable to create or add Apple ID to the device, this iPhone has been used to activate maximum free accounts on this device which with it being new was strange to say the least.Spoke to Apple support who got me to reset the device, deleted Apple ID and create a new one on my laptop, got signed in, brilliant or so I believed.  Using the device and it throws me out of iStore and iCloud, so again speak to Apple who are stumped but say likely to be activation glitch or the OS.  Speak to Tesco who arrange to collect the device, fine.  1st call from Tesco repair your device is being investigated by our senior techs, strange but said fine.  Get another call today to say they found touch screen issues and that the touch screen is non-genuine!  This is supposedly a brand new device which was shrink wrapped, if I had tampered it I wouldn't have been stupid enough to send it for repair.  They want £550 to send a replacement AND still want £24 per month regardless if I chose to pay for a replacement or not, shocking and taking it further legally."

I’ve had many problems with them and they always over charge you for things. They don’t resolve anything till months later. You don’t get sent over to manager either it’s the customer care team wich resolve nothing beside say ‘we are sorry your experiencing the’ but then when you £2 short of your bill they send a letter to say the phone will be cut off that day. After replacing a sim that was lost didn’t receive it until 9 weeks later. Experience a lot of no signal on the phone itself. And they do nothing about it.  Worst experience ever. Company should stop with mobile contacts because they don’t know how to manage anything.

I wasn’t thinking straight as I have had a lot on my plate coming to terms with serious illnesses and disability that has been life changing and very traumatic. I was offered the iPhone 7 and to be honest I don’t know much about technology. I wanted a phone with a large screen I was lied to by the sales guy who told me it did have a large screen. Imagine my dismay when it finally arrived! The smallest most pathetic sized screen ever! Plus I knew nothing about the difference between an iPhone or Android. It was a nightmare for me to grasp initially and the size of the screen is a real problem for me because it is extremely difficult to manage to text. I need a bigger screen to enable me to hold it easier without dropping it. I decided to stick with the phone and see if I got used to it. It’s awful and the worst phone I have ever owned! I always purchased my own sim free handset and got my pay monthly sim Tesco talked me into getting one of their contract phones and I could even own an iPhone! It seemed too good to be true!!! And yes it was!!!! Do not trust these people!!!! I am just off the phone to them. I’m really upset because I wanted to change the handset to a larger size android phone that would make it easier for me to use because of my disability. I’m really struggling to manage to use the phone. But I’m told I will have to pay the full price of the phone!!!!!! I’m utterly shocked at the lack of care and compassion. I was polite and close to tears. I’m very unwell and I live alone. I’m feeling vulnerable enough as it is. I’m unable to work sadly due to my health issues. I have been mislead and ripped off. I can’t afford to pay for the phone. The lady I spoke to wouldn’t allow me to speak to the manager. She said it would not change the rules. I’m really upset. I’m shocked to the core. I’m going to leave Tesco mobile. I’ve never experienced this type of thing ever. I should never have fallen for the dodgy sales patter. I would say avoid this company. They don’t care a jot about the needs of their customers they only care about themselves and conning money out of unsuspecting individuals especially when they are at their most vulnerable. AVOID!

This I was told I could do with open arms (They we’re getting a sale). They said once I had set up the account with a one off message to the phone, that I could access the account and manage it accordingly. I had to ask the care home to do this for me as it was going to be a one off, but  No it wasn’t a one off but has to be done every time. Spent hours on chat and the phone put a complaint in and told still cannot do it and I am never going to. My mum has used Tesco for over ten years on pay as you go u til she was incapacitated due to ill health. Tesco are not helping in the covid situation nor looking after the elderly. They are answering questions to the script and being run by robots. All I want is to be able to access the online account without a code being sent to my mum who is 15 miles away and who can not retrieve texts each time I try to log onto the account.

At least I don't find any problem in using it. There is one thing, if you are pay as you go, good luck in using the payment system powered by Mi-pay. I can't remember my password and I can't reset. You enter your email address and they are not sending you the password recovery. Checked the spam folder and all that. Last month I got my password recovery email after a few hours later. This month I don't get the recovery email at all. I am not sure if they intentionally force you to register your card with them on the phone and take payment automatically.

I should say, I rate Tesco, the store for nothing; I have never liked what I see as its shrewd, greedy business 'non-ethic' - the Christmas voucher 'scandal' of a few years back is a fair case in point, altered swiftly only when it attracted media coverage whilst previously dismissing complaints from its own paying clients.  And so, not least for their relatively high prices and 3 for 2 and other such 'deals'  - also rumbled as a scam more than once by consumer programmes where it was shown to be cheaper to buy as individual items - I cheerfully boycotted them some years ago for the fantastic German supermarket beginning with 'A.' Much less greedy; rather, not greedy at all. They lost the war/s. Good luck to them that they are winning on the retail front. Put simply and as I see it, that benefits everyone. Credit where it's due! P.S, for those that are unaware of advertising-speak. 'Deal' or 'Limited Offer,' and in some cases even 'Special Offer,' and variations on that theme means only this... ""We will sell this to you. It is for sale."" There is no legal inference whatsoever that it is a 'good deal' or cheaper than usual.See it as it is. HOWEVER....Tescomobile has served me admirably. It feels very much a separate entity, certainly in terms of price and quality of service. Some others say differently here and I respect that.Based on my experience as a fair hard-task master and for those reasons, I would recommend you check them out while, of course, comparing with the competition.

He is autistic and at time of purchase (in store) we asked that we as his parents (and the bill payers) should be the point of contact for customer services and provided my mobile telephone number for this. We were told this would be no problem. So far so good.We then tried repeatedly to set up a direct debit to pay the bill, both online and with customer services via phone. Without explanation neither was successful and a ‘regular payment’ was set up by Tesco instead.Later in the year I used a bank account switcher service. Unfortunately the regular payment was not switched (as this is held by Tesco, not the bank account) causing 2 payments to be missed before I was made aware. I was only made aware by my son, who said that TESCO had text him. Sadly he had not past this on to us, because he is not good at communication.I paid the outstanding 2 months, but the service was not resumed. I then contacted customer services to raise this only to be told that we were being disconnected and would be charged almost all the outstanding months of the contract.When I complained (online) asking why they did not try to speak to me about the issue. TESCO claim they had sent a letter and an email, but none were received. Customer services told me there’s nothing they can do because the system is all automated.This leaves us we no service provided and Tesco cashing in through their poor service. I feel as though we have been scammed.I was given a number to ring for the disconnections team, who I was told may be able to reduce the disconnection charge due to the sequence of events. However it is impossible to get through to this team and I have spent hours on hold.In the time that has passed not being able to contact the disconnections team I have now received and aggressive message from a collections agency saying that TESCO has sold my debt to them and my credit rating has been affected. Further salt in the wound is that the debt collection agency has had no trouble contacting me by mobile when TESCO completely failed with the same details. My mobile is now being spammed by TESCO's debt collector. This is a absolute nightmare experience that I feel TESCO failure play a large part in creating.UPDATE:In response to TESCO's reply asking me to contact their customer services regarding the issues raised in my review, I did. Their response was and I quote,""I’d request you to purchase a new contract on a new account.""When I replied expressing my utter dismay at this response the reply was and again I quote, ""I understand this was not the response you were hoping for""A total disgrace TESCO! TESCO's reply to my review was completely disingenuous as they never had any intentions of trying to make things right."

And plus having more than one handset gives family discount up to £2 for each handset and saved Tesco vouchers I can apply with double the amount to the bill.

I was notified on the app it was delivered (while at home already waiting as it told me I was next) I looked out and seen the van the driver leaving?? I checked outside my door and downstairs no parcel?? I contacted dpd and the driver said he left the parcel outside my door? I say again There was no parcel! So made a dispute with dpd and then contacted Tesco mobile to get a replacement delivery but.. here’s the best bitWhen speaking to their customer services I was told there was nothing they could do and they couldn’t send me a replacement?? But I could get a whole new order and pay upfront costs AGAIN but would be responsible for the first missing phones contract also So I’m stuck paying for a phone I never even received due to your crappy courier service Even thoughUnder the Consumer Rights Act and the Consumer Contracts Regulations, the goods remain your responsibility until they are received by me and your responsibility to replace the item within 24 to 48 hours and your responsibility to dispute it with your courier service.But are fobbing me off with excuses like I have to wait until dpd resolve the complaint ? Asking for more money to replace Which is untrue it is your responsibility under the consumer right act to replace the missing item So I’m left waiting who knows how long for a resolution with no phone and paying for a phone I never even received in the mean time  Look like we will have to take this even further  thanks Tesco"

To finalise the claim you need to have removed your mobile from the Apple cloud but to do so you really need your mobile (the broken run over one!) to work or you cannot access the Apple verification code.  The other option (although it is not working!) is to remove your ID from the Apple cloud, which I have done but you still cannot progress the claim.   When you phone up Tesco for help they point you in the direction of their insurer who do not answer their phones.

So needless to say this is a very biased review.Okay, So my phone had randomly stopped working one day, the phone ""black-screened"" and basically everything seemed to be working (notifications came through etc) but the screen was black. (Therefore, I had no chance to backup my photos etc - this is important later on). So as to not break the warranty on the phone (the phone was less than a year old) I decided to use Tesco's phone repair service as opposed to going to a third-party repair service, as I would have done (this is also important haha).I was basically told once the phone had already been sent off that the phone had water damage (typical) to the camera and that they were unable to fix it. So I was given the option to a) pay around £70 for a second hand lesser model (a returned phone) or b) pay off the rest of my contract and upgrade.So like an idiot and stressed because I was without a phone in a pandemic, I decided to pay off the contract and upgrade. So I got a new phone, they sent the old one back. Now, Tesco has a policy where they wipe phones sent in for repair. I assumed this only applied to phones they actually FIXED. No, it applies to all phones.  So firstly, why the hell would I pay for a second-hand phone? (while also having to pay off the rest of my contract). Then why bother sending me back my broken phone (which I just had to pay for) after wiping the data? Also, if you can't fix the phone shouldn't that be on you? Why should I have to pay for a broken phone because the team ""can't fix it""? The phone was less than a year old. I thought the silver lining with tesco not being able to fix the phone would be that I could get my photos back if I took it somewhere else. But they wiped the phone so now I have a useless a40 sitting in my draw. I'm mostly leaving this review because I'm upset, as the phone was so new and I feel like my desperation during this time and that stupid warranty left me feeling a tad bit exploited and pressured into upgrading. Which I get it they're a company its what they do - still doesn't mean I can't be annoyed with it. I suppose I can sell it for parts, but I'd prefer to have my data back than a few quid."

Incidentally, who ever is in charge of the tesco contracts sales, had better realise that keeping potential customers on the phone for 20 minutes a time is not a good way of selling contracts.Response to Tesco's reply.   Yes indeed, I know how you delude yourselves in believing that this is how it works. However the point of this post is to inform people of your delusion and the fact that it does not work. Clubcard staff know nothing of this arrangement, leaving customers trapped between Clubcard staff and Tesco's Mobile staff, you could not make it any worse its a total pock up."

I first phoned and spoke to a woman who was rude and would not listen “we’re going round in circles here” she said, I knew I paid my bill and she insisted that I was 3 months behind on my bill and the payment I had made which she could see, was paying my May bill, even though I had paid that to, no matter how many times I told her that it was impossible, and that I was not 3 months behind on my bill, I went to email and they tell me they can’t even see this payment, to then saying it was showing as unsuccessful. But the woman on the phone could? Nearly 3 weeks I was unlocked out of my phone. The team was supposed to get back to me about this payment within 3 working days, after 5 working days I had to email again, for them to say I have 3 days to pay the bill, that I had already paid, and showed proof or they was permanently cutting my contract. Finally after my reply to that, they credited my account, and I’m back to using my data and calls I had paid for, absolute joke of a company, and certainly leaving. Nearly 3 weeks of stress, lack of communication and lies. Never again."

The reason for being unhappy with their service - Tesco Mobile repeatedly miscommunicated fees and billing amounts. I closed my account with them on 5th June 2020 by phone and paid the early termination charge. I was shocked to later receive unwarranted letters from Tesco Mobile after this date warning that further payments were due. ""if you don't settle this account your credit rating could be affected"". Tesco Mobile continued issuing bills after the date I paid the early termination charge and closed the account. It created a lot of stress and wasted a lot of time. A very poor customer experience.It took 14-15 hours of trying to find answers and get support. I eventually had the invoice canceled and the account closed. It was shocking that no redress was given for the inconceivable dereliction of duty to its customers by Tesco Mobile.-----------In response to Tesco Mobile:If this was an issue, the multiple customer service representitives I engaged were not knowledgable of this possibility. There were many further negative customer experiences recorded during this customer journey. One outstanding direct quote from a Tesco Customer Service representitive: ""the email services has been down for 2 to 3 months now"""

This is similar to the Amazon ""1-click"" and you're debited for on-line media! It took me some further research and telephone call to Tesco Customer Services to explain the problem. As a pensioner I cannot afford to pay for regular RocketPacks every month! I recommend that Tesco Mobile alerts users that they are about to permanently switch tariffs (as with energy suppliers) so that we can opt-out and go back to the home page.

It would be nice if you trusted your customers or at least say you will look into it rather than fobbing me off and telling me to take my SIM card out to clean it.

My message to you Tesco Mobile is this,  I have been your loyal customer for more than four years. I trusted you and I trusted your company to use my Direct Debit but you have lost my trust and offering me chips for the money that you have thieved from me is below the standards of Financial Ombudsman expectations.

Firstly I received the phone promptly after ordering and proceeded to arrrange transfer of my existing number, Tesco’s first incompetence left me with 4 days of no service while they thought about transferring my number, even on contacting the online help chat they couldn’t seem to clarify when everything would be changed over but they seemed to be trying and the number was changed over ( though not fully as some messages still come up with a random number). After a few weeks of perseverance and complete frustration a Tesco staff member confirmed by the the phone is faulty and must be sent for repair and it’ll take 7-10 days. No they won’t give me a replacement, I was told that I should have taken insurance out if I wanted a replacement for a faulty phone i have owned for 3 weeks apparently. I was then told to go in to a Tesco mobile store and a colleague there would check it. I duly did, after a few shrugs of his shoulders and a “ well that’s our policy” the shop manager agreed to replace my phone if I brought the charger and everything back, checking that he did have the phone in stock I left and returned with everything required. He then tells me that he can’t change the phone he has in stock at Tesco mobile store because I bought the phone online and the web chat guy should never have sent me in there. I then called customer service from outside the Tesco store with the Exact replacement Phone sitting in stock to be told that the earliest I could have a replacement sent out would be Wednesday, another 4 days of unreliable and totally useless service that I am paying for when there is a solution sitting in the store in front of me. It’s very apparent that once Tesco have you signed up and locked in the “every little helps” slogan becomes “we will do very little to help”. So after many hours spent trying to get get a resolution through lots of misinformation, I am further inconvenienced by having an unreliable phone for a further few days and then a day off work to wait for the new phone to be delivered when I know and was told by the store manager that he had the very replacement phone I needed in the store in front of me. Absolutely awful customer service."

I tried to reboot it and restore it to factory settings and nothing works. There were two girls in the Tesco store in taunton somerset and they were both utterly useless. One girl with pink hair just played on her phone and the other girl who served me said ""what do you want me to do about it"" she didn't even look at my phone. It was a waste of time. I tried going through a claim online through tesco insurance and that's just as useless. They want to send me a replacement. I don't want a replacement i want my phone fixed. Apparently according to the insurance my repair could be over £500 which is utterly ridiculous when I already pay for insurance."

(Do they want my account?)They haven’t even responded to my complaint of last week! If they are short staffed they shouldn’t take on new business? So? Do I complain about the complaint???

I left Tesco mobile for ONE and ONE reason only (no Wifi-Assist calls as I am living in a 'black spot' for phone signal) but after just a week with Vodafone, I ran back to Tesco with a huge slice of humble pie... No Wifi assist was a small inconvenience compared to nightmare that the other supplier was.I find the app keeps everything very transparent and simple.Good job Tesco! (but please give us wifi-assist soon!!)"

Suggested i check with royal mail. Royal mail hold my address. Called Tesco. They advised they check details with Equifax who do not hold my address ? Have lived at same address for 20 years, registered to vote ect. Advised it would take 20 days to get Equifax to add my details. Tesco blamed Equifax. If Equifax is so bad why use them. Never had issues with address finders before. Registered with other credit agency, no problem. Have cancelled my current mobile phone contract. So will be without a mobile phone. Live on my own and no landline. Very disappointed with Tesco"

My phone has not worked, I have missed numerous calls, one of them being a very very very important one!!! My internet has not worked properly, I have never reached my 20gb limit the whole time with tesco (and any other provider for that matter) but the last month my internet has done nothing but load (but not actually load anything), it takes 20 minutes to load one link and then when it loads it buffers so doesn't actually work so I end up closing whatever I was trying to look at. I ended up buying an extra 20gb which also didn't work properly. When contacting tesco they said they would give me £5 off because the mast in my area was not working, then 10gb of the extra 20gb was then used withtin 4 hours on the night (WHILST I WAS ASLEEP) I contacted tesco to tell them this and they added a free 2gb of data on. I was still not happy as I was getting no signal at all and no internet and still had to pay the bill even though I had not received what I was paying for but then to top it off, my bill come through and I had not received the £5 off, I was being charged £7.50 for the 'FREE 2GB', I have literally had to speak to tesco customer service like 3/4 times this month the amount of stress this company is causing me is crazy. No signal, no internet and I still have to pay for the service, it will be a weight lifted off my shoulders when my contract ends and hopefully i will be able to use my phone properly again!"

Seems they can't get a straight story between them. I was not told anything about temporary tariffs or not being able to upgrade until the next billing period. Perhaps I need to speak to the ombudsman as this involves credit agreements. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have been a Tesco Mobile customer since 2014. Over the years, I have recommended them to people for their excellent customer service and smooth operation when it comes to upgrades. Regretfully, 6 years of recommending Tesco Mobile to others has come to an end for me.I first got in contact with Tesco Mobile on Twitter to see if there was any way I could still get a deal on their website. My free early upgrade was due mid-September, and this deal expired a week or so before. I was told in no uncertain terms ""no"", which as a customer of 6 years I felt was disappointing but c'est la vie. I had a look at other providers, as I thought Tesco were perhaps becoming a bit expensive anyway.I found some other deals with other providers (EE, Vodafone) and contacted Tesco Mobile once again, this time via their online chat, to make sure there was definitely no chance of receiving the deal. Again, I was told no unless I paid the early upgrade fee which I thought was a little annoying for the sake of a week and the fact I had been with them 6 years. I know other providers do have customer retention offers in place.A week or so later, I decided to upgrade anyway as my phone screen was smashed and it was beginning to cut my fingers and ears when making phone calls. My own fault, so I decided to pay the upgrade fee.The website advised if I ordered before 4pm, I would receive my phone within 2 days. I decided to opt for this, as I would receive my phone either Friday or Saturday as I ordered Thursday morning.DPD provided tracking on Friday morning to say my handset would be delivered between 17:23 and 18:23 on Friday. I got someone to wait in, as I had to pick up the grocery shopping on my way home from work.I got in around 18:30, and the handset had not arrived. I asked DPD on their live chat and they told me the delivery driver was delayed, but would be with me shortly.At 19:30, DPD identified that ""something was wrong"" and they put me through to a human. She advised if the handset was not delivered that day, it would ""definitely"" be delivered the day after (Saturday).After ignoring me for almost 10 minutes, the adviser came back to say there was a backlog at the depot and the handset would not be delivered until Monday. I was confused, as the handset had been out for delivery since 11am and she had said if not today, it would be tomorrow.I then contacted Tesco Mobile Customer Care by telephone to see what my options were. They advised they could cancel the upgrade, as I mentioned I would have rather have gone in the store than wait till Monday as the website advised 2 days maximum. They said they would cancel the upgrade, refund the money and I could go in the next day to upgrade.Wrong.Whilst I did receive my refund, I could not in fact upgrade the next day.I arrived to their in-store branch and was met with 2 advisers slumped over their desk, watching videos on their phones. Once they noticed me, they jumped up and were attentive however once it came to light that I would not be able to upgrade after all that attentiveness disappeared. They called Customer Care however after 7 minutes said, ""shall I just give you the number so you can do it yourself?"". The last straw was when another member of Tesco staff walked by the phone shop and he rolled his eyes at her. Like I said, this is not the kind of customer service I would recommend to friends, families or colleagues. I went home, sorted the issue out myself on the phone - they told me on the phone they could order me another phone and took an ""upgrade"" fee, but I'll get back to that later - and wrote to Tesco Mobile to express my disappointment in the service I'd received so far. The website promises a response within 24 hours.Well, it is nearing 96 hours now and I have had no response to my e-mail.I contacted Tesco Mobile twice via their online chat. At between 15:00 - 15:30 yesterday, I was promised contact from the complaints team by 17:00.It is 10:20 the next day and I have not heard a peep from them. On Monday, I also received a call to say they couldn't order the phone after all and the ""upgrade fee"" I had paid was actually an ad hoc payment towards my next bill - which I did not agree to!Take it from a long-term customer - do not use Tesco Mobile. Go to a real mobile phone service provider."

No body told me this when i purchased the phone i could potentially be in a bad situation late at night and cannot ring certain numbers to get accomodation, its not on when you've paid for a months coverage upfront.

She succeeded in telling me the phone I was looking for wasn’t in stock here and that’s where the conversation ended. I would have appreciated guidance on where to go from here (e.g. these are the phones we do have, or have you tried online etc etc).TSECO Mobile Has great deals but I’ll be sticking with Three. At least they want my business."
